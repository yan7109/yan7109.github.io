<h1>Sample M&A Outreach Emails</h1>
<p class="resource-intro">Keep your outbound emails simple and actionable. Make sure each email has only one recipient - too many recipients will dilute the urgency and ownership of your reachout.</p>

<div class="checklist-section">
  <h2>Template 1: When You Have Actionable Offers</h2>
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Use this when your board has received an actionable M&A offer and you want to run a competitive process.</p>

  <div class="email-template">
    <div class="subject">Subject: <span class="placeholder">[Your Company]</span> M&A Update</div>

    Hi <span class="placeholder">[Executive of Potential Acquiring Company]</span>,<br><br>

    I wanted to be the first to tell you that we are starting an M&A process. Recently, our board received an actionable M&A offer, and wanted to run a process and invite you to be part of it as we value our relationship and feel that the potential of teaming up with <span class="placeholder">[Acquiring Company]</span> could create the biggest impact.<br><br>

    Let me know if this might be an actionable opportunity for you.<br><br>

    Thanks,<br><br>

    <span class="placeholder">[Your Signature]</span><br>
    <span class="placeholder">[Your Phone Number]</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="checklist-section">
  <h2>Template 2: Starting a Discovery Process (No Offers Yet)</h2>
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Use this when you're exploring M&A but don't have offers in hand. Always lead with a business update before mentioning M&A.</p>

  <div class="email-template">
    <div class="subject">Subject: <span class="placeholder">[Your Company]</span> M&A Update</div>

    Hi <span class="placeholder">[Executive of Potential Acquiring Company]</span>,<br><br>

    I wanted to give you two updates on <span class="placeholder">[Your Company]</span>.<br><br>

    First is our latest <span class="placeholder">[key business/product update that is relevant to the acquiring company - something short, sweet, and noteworthy. If the acquiring company cares about a particular market, tell them your ARR or growth rate crossing a key threshold. If they care about a particular technology, mention a breakthrough in your R&D or a big product launch]</span>.<br><br>

    Second is that we have decided to fully explore M&A starting this quarter. This isn't driven by operational constraints (we have a strong balance sheet), but rather our desire to find a larger platform to make a bigger market impact.<br><br>

    In advance of that effort, I wanted to reach out and see if this might be an actionable opportunity for you, and we wanted to give you an early look at the opportunity.<br><br>

    Attached is a short deck.<br><br>

    Thanks,<br><br>

    <span class="placeholder">[Your Signature]</span><br>
    <span class="placeholder">[Your Phone Number]</span>

  <h2>Key Principles</h2>

    <div class="checklist-box"></div>
    <div class="checklist-text"><strong>One recipient per email.</strong> Mass emails dilute urgency and ownership.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="checklist-item">
    <div class="checklist-box"></div>
    <div class="checklist-text"><strong>Cold email won't work.</strong> Make sure whoever you are emailing has a strong personal relationship with you, otherwise reachout to your network for an intro.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="checklist-item">
    <div class="checklist-box"></div>
    <div class="checklist-text"><strong>Lead with value.</strong> Give them something to chew on, either sense of FOMO from another offer (do not disclose who you are talking to), or a strategic milestone they care about.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="checklist-item">
    <div class="checklist-box"></div>
    <div class="checklist-text"><strong>Don't sound desperate.</strong> Emphasize this is about impact, not operational constraints.</div>

  <div class="checklist-item">
    <div class="checklist-box"></div>
    <div class="checklist-text"><strong>Include your phone number.</strong> Make it easy for them to reach you directly.</div>
