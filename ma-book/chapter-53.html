  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>As you reach the end of this process, understand one thing: your best days still lie ahead. Companies can be acquired, sold, go bankrupt, or go public. But your identity and value are not defined by the business you built. They live in the relationships you made, the people you helped, and how you grew along the way.</p>
<p>Whether this M&amp;A process exceeded your expectations or left you underwhelmed, you now have a set of experiences that very few people ever go through. Use what you learned, both the wins and the hard lessons, to do something meaningful next.</p>
<p>Whether your next step is to stick through the retention period, start another company, mentor other founders, invest in startups, or do something completely different, this journey is a foundation you can build on.</p>
<p>Your story doesn't end here. Go do amazing things.</p>
