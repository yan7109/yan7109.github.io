  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Here are mistakes I made when we went through the M&amp;A discovery process and ended up with no acceptable offers in 2022. These mistakes wasted time and resources, cost us key employees, and caused a lot of pain. All of it could have been avoided.</p>
<p>1. I spent all my time on M&amp;A tasks and detached from the company's day-to-day work. When no deal happened, I had an identity crisis. I should have kept contributing to the parts of company building I enjoyed.</p>
<p>2. We clung to our original thesis even after the market clearly moved on. We had early inbounds based on that thesis. But when the tide turned and nobody cared about the creator economy anymore, we should have pivoted fast and gone back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>3. I wasn't open-minded about what the joint venture could look like. Each acquirer had their own vision, and we were too insistent on ours. One company wanted to acquire us for our software tools expertise, but we insisted the future was all about community. They weren't interested and passed on us after a full due diligence.</p>
<p>4. We set up a carve-out bonus for the whole team too early, expecting a deal was imminent. We were confident we'd find a buyer before June 2023. That date came and went with no acceptable offers. Everyone got a one-time bonus but also learned we couldn't find a buyer. Two key employees left.</p>
<p>5. We told the whole team we were exploring M&amp;A. This was the worst mistake. It gave everyone false expectations that we'd be bought for an insane amount of money. Some employees exercised their options early, expecting favorable capital gains tax treatment. The initial excitement lasted a week or two, then turned to anxiety, then despair.</p>
<p>Every 1-1 stopped being about product building and became me giving M&amp;A updates. In a perverse way, it felt like the employees were no longer working for me. I was working for them. Once I told people the company was going to be sold and the goal was to retain everyone, some employees decided they were unfireable. Do not tell employees that the company is for sale.</p>
<p>Here are a couple more mistakes, based on stories from other founders, that you should avoid.</p>
<p>1. Many founders jump into a term sheet too early without enough market discovery or due diligence. They don't realize that term sheets are often non-binding and exclusive. Once signed, the buyer holds all the cards. They stop replying to emails and let the term sheet expire after deciding it's not a fit. It's much better to agree on strategy, finish the necessary due diligence, and then sign the term sheet. That increases the odds of closing and keeps the maximum number of acquirers in the process.</p>
<p>2. Rage quitting when things go badly. This is the worst thing a cofounder can do. The other cofounders or investors have to step in and clean up the mess. It destroys your reputation and usually leads to the worst financial outcome. If you're thinking about walking away, draw up succession plans first and think it through seriously before throwing in the towel.</p>
