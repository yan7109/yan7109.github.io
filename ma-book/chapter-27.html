  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Most M&A conversations do not get beyond the first meeting. So if a second meeting gets scheduled, it is a huge deal. The stakes get higher from this point on. Even if the other party were a competitor trying to get the lay of the land, they would typically just request some materials after the initial meeting and ghost you. With big tech companies, getting all the right people in the same room requires a ton of coordination and weeks of lead time. Unless there is something real, a meeting would not be scheduled.</p>
<p>The potential acquirer may request additional materials before deciding on a second meeting. These include prior fundraising and valuation documents, an org chart with each employee's role and experience, P&L statements from the last three years, product growth and retention metrics, product roadmaps, technology stack, and overall architecture. Some may even request access to your data room at this point.</p>
<p>Before sending these materials, make sure to execute a mutual NDA. It's better to request the NDA from the acquiring company and suggest edits, rather than having your lawyer draft one from scratch. This reduces back and forth, and you can get to the real discussion without spending weeks negotiating NDA terms.</p>
<p>Once the NDA is signed, be liberal with providing docs. Withholding requested info could cause the buyer to lose interest or think you are not serious about the deal. The buyer always has the information advantage.</p>
<p>As an aside, if the potential buyer is eager to share their own financial statements, forecasts, or future roadmap this early, that is a red flag. They may be more desperate to close this deal than you are.</p>
<p>You are in a great situation if they are rich in cash or have great future prospects like an imminent IPO or funding round. But more often, the reason they share all this info unsolicited is desperation. Maybe the board directed them to expand into a certain sector. Maybe they need an acquisition in your space to raise funding. In the worst case, they are looking to do a rollup, issuing you private stock in hopes of absorbing your revenue and cash balance.</p>
<p>At this point, expect the actual decision maker to be in the meeting, along with people whose input matters. If it is a highly strategic acquisition, expect a C-level officer and her lieutenants. One of the lieutenants will likely drive the conversation if you are engaging with a big company.</p>
<p>Here is a rough gauge. If the acquiring company has ten times or more your headcount, a lieutenant (typically a VP of product) would manage the process. If the acquiring company is not ten times bigger, the CEO, COO, or CPO would be your direct point of contact. If the acquiring company is one of the magnificent seven or equivalent large cap tech companies, you will work with a Director or VP who is likely the person absorbing your company into her org.</p>
<p>Expect corp dev to play a secondary role from here on. The conversation will vary depending on seniority. If C-suite executives attend, the discussion will be highly strategic and forward-looking. If the most senior people are engineering or product managers, it will be tactical and deep on implementation.</p>
<p>Treat this like a highly technical job interview. Everything is fair game. On the product side: company metrics, customer personas, user journey, user interviews, UI/UX, and positioning. On the engineering side: technology stack, engineering tradeoffs, implementation details, and specific usage of frameworks.</p>
<p>Ask for an agenda in advance. Spend plenty of time preparing and practicing. Figure out beforehand which cofounder fields which questions. Make sure everyone gets a chance to present. It is not a great sign when only one person speaks during this meeting.</p>
<p>Questions from the buyer may become more pointed about deal expectations. Again, punt this to your board. The goal is to maximize information exchange. Ideally, line up all your M&A conversations so that offers arrive around the same time. Or at least have enough conversations going so that when one offer comes in, other companies are in a position to make a competing offer.</p>
<p>The meeting typically ends with the buyer asking for a few days to huddle and sync up on their thoughts before discussing the next steps. If everything goes well, there will be a meeting scheduled to discuss financial expectations in parallel with a formal due diligence process. This typically will happen very quickly. It could even happen at the end of the meeting if the buyer is super motivated.</p>
<p>You may be asked for more supporting materials right after the meeting. Most likely the data room will be requested at this point if it hasn’t been already.</p>
<p>If you don't get a response within a couple days, you likely won't hear back for weeks. Or you'll get some vague response about people being on vacation, saying they remain excited but asking you to stay patient.</p>
<p>A decision is usually made right after the meeting. If the buyer wants to proceed, tasks are set in motion immediately. If the answer is no, the internal champion takes the action item to inform you. But there is no urgency on their side to deliver bad news. That task gets pushed to the bottom of her list. So you won't hear back for weeks, or at all, even with persistent pings.</p>
