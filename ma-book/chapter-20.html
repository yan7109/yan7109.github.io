  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Before engaging with any potential buyers, make sure your lieutenants are set up for success. The company's metrics still need to go up and to the right while you're exploring M&amp;A. Designate one of your executives to hold down the fort while you and your cofounders attend meetings and interact with buyers.</p>
<p>The meetings themselves don't take that much time. But the market research and preparation will keep your hands full. Many of these meetings are your only shot to make an impression. Prepare so that every demo works, every obscure metric rolls off your tongue, and you appear genuinely excited about working together with the acquiring company.</p>
<p>Set clear goals for your lieutenants so the company runs on its own while you and your cofounders are unreachable. Give them the freedom to make their own decisions, but check in regularly on progress. Once you tell your board you're exploring M&amp;A, cancel your regular board meetings. Offer email updates on progress and key metrics instead. Drop unnecessary recurring meetings. Stretch out the frequency of your one-on-ones. Your calendar should be as light as possible in the coming months so you can focus entirely on M&amp;A.</p>
<p>As mentioned in previous chapters, don't explain to the team why your calendars are blocked and you're unreachable. Even your closest lieutenants should only be looped in when they need to be involved in due diligence or interviews, when the deal becomes more of a certainty. Looping in the team too early puts them on a roller coaster they have no visibility into and no control over. It can lead to employee churn when things go badly (they often will) or expectation mismatches when the deal is announced. They may expect to rake in millions but instead find themselves laid off without health insurance.</p>
<p>Instead, reset communication expectations. Tell the team you won't be available for many synchronous meetings because of upcoming partnership discussions. Communications are shifting to async, and response times will be slower. Work with your lieutenants to set a roadmap for the next couple quarters. Give them full authority to execute once you sign off.</p>
<p>It will be tough not sharing this with the team. But trust me, it's tougher when you do. The excitement wears off in a couple days. Then every interaction becomes "what's happening with the M&amp;A?" They will be disappointed and jaded when the company doesn't find a buyer, or when the exit they expected to be worth a billion turns out to be much, much smaller.</p>
