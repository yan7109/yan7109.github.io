  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>This is the most exciting part of the M&A. To be desired. To hear how you and your cofounders built something special. How the acquiring company loves the idea of working together. How this is a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. None of this is real, and not all inbound inquiries are created equal. The inbound could be a spur-of-the-moment idea from an executive who would forget about buying your company in a couple days and chase her next big idea. Or it could be from a junior analyst or Corp Dev doing market research who wants some first hand knowledge from you. Stay even keeled and put your best foot forward to lean in and learn. As you engage with these inbound inquiries, the goals are to:</p>
<p>1. Figure out if you are talking to the key decision maker for a potential M&amp;A? If not, figure out who is the decision maker.</p>
<p>2. Once you are engaging with the decision maker, determine if she is interested in collaborations, partnerships or an acquisition.</p>
<p>3. It is fine to engage with a partnership initially, and in fact oftentimes it is necessary before these relationships are borne into an M&amp;A, but make expectations clear to the other party that your goal is an acquisition.</p>
<p>4. I do not recommend agreeing on a price this early. Pushing for a price tag without enough discovery could lead the buyer to think you are only in it for the money. On the other extreme, you could get locked into a non-binding exclusive term-sheet period where the buyer has all the leverage and you cannot talk to any other potential suitors.</p>
<p>Let's walk through a real example. We received the following cold email from a tech giant in late 2021,</p>
<div class="email-block">
  <p class="email-header">On Sep 29, 2021, at 4:33 PM, *** &lt;***@***.com&gt; wrote:</p>
  <p class="short-line">Hi Borui –</p>
  <p>I support our *** initiatives within ***. My team is responsible for the *** Platform shared across all of our *** product offerings.</p>
  <p>I am impressed by the work you and your team have been doing at Polarr on photo editing. I was wondering if you would be open to have an introductory chat with me and my Director of ***, *** (cc'ed), on the work that you are doing, with the objective of finding potential collaborative opportunities. We would love to learn more on the fun stuff that you are working on at Polarr!</p>
  <p>Please let me know if you would be open to this and we can coordinate the logistics around this. Looking forward to connecting!</p>
  <p class="short-line">Thanks</p>
  <p class="short-line">***</p>
</div>
<p>To an untrained eye, this looks like another cold introductory email that quickly gets tossed in the trash. Unknown sender, completely out of the blue. But a couple signals are worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>First, it did not come from a Corp Dev. It came from a Research Manager with a technical background, and his Director was copied. This signals an acquihire scenario. Engineering leadership reach outs typically mean they are short on staff and looking to quickly bring on more people. Product or senior executive level inbound inquiries are more likely to be strategic.</p>
<p>Second, his role within the organization has a clear parallel with the SDKs and services that our company sells. He has done his research on our product offerings.</p>
<p>Third, the giveaway is the phrase "collaborative opportunities." Big tech companies rarely mention acquisition in the email, especially from a non-Corp Dev role. It is a way to save face in case the founders turn it down, where nothing can be learned without even a conversation. The objective is clear. They are looking at companies in this space and looking to shore up their bench.</p>
<p>To reply to such emails, keep the message short and also make sure you do some market research on their product offerings and offer ample availability so that a meeting can be scheduled quickly. We replied with the following:</p>
<div class="email-block">
  <p class="short-line">Hi ***,</p>
  <p>Thanks for reaching out. We were just looking for AR SDKs to integrate into one of our apps and definitely happy to chat. How does next week look for a call?</p>
</div>
<p>Things tend to move quickly at this point. The potential acquirer may email back to ask for a short presentation on your background, team, mission, product roadmap, technical capabilities, and long term goals. You can modify the slides from Chapter 15 and customize them for the other party.</p>
<p>Set a date about one week out. Not so far away that they forget about the opportunity. Not so soon that it signals desperation. For the same reason, do not send polished M&A themed slide decks before the first meeting. It sends the wrong signal. If they ask for pre-reading materials, put everything in a Google Doc that only covers what they asked for.</p>
<p>You may not get all of these inbounds at once. But try to line everything up when you are ready to engage in the M&A market so that conversations happen at the same time. If you have had relationships with companies that previously reached out about M&A or are outbound targets, this is the perfect time to reach back out and ask for meetings (we will talk about it in Chapter 23).</p>
<p>They don't all have to happen at once. But try to time conversations so that when the offering phase arrives, due diligence is already complete. You don't want to be waiting on stragglers to reveal what a potential offer looks like. Now let's look at what the inside looks like when an inbound company reaches out about a possible M&A.</p>
