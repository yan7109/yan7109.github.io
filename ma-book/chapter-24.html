    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 24</span>The Inside View from an Outbound Reach Out</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>How an outbound reachout gets handled depends on how strong your relationship is with the recipient. Let's rank them from strongest to weakest.</p>
<p>The key assumption is that you either know the recipients personally, or you can be introduced by someone with a strong relationship. Cold emails do not work for M&As. This is different from any other type of sales. M&As require a much higher standard of trust and are built on prior relationships. Cold outreach implies desperation and would never yield an acceptable outcome.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Direct Personal Contact</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Because M&As are built on prior relationships, how seriously your contact pushes your inquiry forward depends on two things: how high she ranks within the acquiring company and how strong your relationship is with her. But because this is an outbound inquiry, unless you have leverage from an existing offer, the likelihood of this becoming an M&A offer is tiny.</p>
<p>If your contact is not in a product or engineering leadership position (director or above in publicly traded companies) with strategic influence, it's better to get an intro through your investor or board to someone with decision power. When the outreach email lands on her desk, if this M&A is relevant to her own organization, it can lead to more conversations. If not, the best she can do is forward your email to other product organizations or corporate development. At that point, there is little chance anything comes of it.</p>
<p>So it is critical that the person you are reaching out to is already in a role where this opportunity is relevant to her. Do your homework early. Identify and build these relationships before activating conversations.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Intro to Senior Executive</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Just like before, the onus is on you to identify the right company with a strategic fit. Then find the right senior officers or executives with strong connections to your board or investors. Do not expect your board members to do all the work for you.</p>
<p>At a minimum, figure out who the key contact is. Study her LinkedIn mutual connections. If your board members are not connected, look at whether their partners or associates are. Then provide a blurb about the company and why an initial meeting is warranted. Check in with your board member and ask if she would be comfortable making an introduction.</p>
<p>This matters because your board member will not have as much context about your business or the angle you want to take. If you delegate this entirely to her, she might be busy and not do it quickly. Or she might identify the wrong person or approach with a weak angle that kills any potential M&A with this target company. Do the work. If the introduction is strong and the senior executive is a fit, you will get a first meeting.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Intro to Corporate Dev</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Corporate Developers' job is to identify potential acquisition targets. They serve as gatekeepers early on and help move things along in later stages. But they work for their business units and typically don't take meetings unless their BU leads direct them to do discovery in a certain space.</p>
<p>When you reach out to a corporate developer, she may review your material, do some research, and decide whether there is a potential fit. If she thinks the opportunity is interesting, she forwards the intro material to her BU leads for feedback. In the rare case that a BU wants to learn more, the corp dev would schedule a first meeting and serve as the initial screen.</p>
<p>This type of reachout is the least effective. Corp devs see M&A solicitations all the time. From founders directly, from personal connections, and from bankers. Think of them like HR at a company that is hiring, except there are no job postings. The probability of a match when sellers approach buyers is close to zero. As explained in earlier chapters, M&As are a buyer's market. Companies are bought, never sold.</p>
