    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 28</span>Should You Run an Official Process?</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>In M&A terms, an official process means setting a timeline, reaching out to all likely buyers, and soliciting interest. It only makes sense in two scenarios. Let's look at them.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Firesale</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This means the founder or a banker sends a mass email to chief executives and corp devs soliciting interest, with a deadline. The email includes a short presentation on the company's financials, governance, personnel, and technology. Some inexperienced bankers or founders even include a line about having strong interest from other buyers, or blatantly lie about having offers.</p>
<p>The truth is, if there is an actionable offer, the founder would be wise to pick only a handful of companies that might also make an offer. The email would lean on prior relationships and use strong introductions. It wouldn't be sent via a mail merge. And if there is strong interest already, why put your company in a weaker position by broadcasting that you are soliciting offers?</p>
<p>This approach is usually a last resort when a company is running out of cash or the founders have decided to quit. If you are in this position, you are looking for any offer to softland the company. It would take a miracle to get an offer from this exercise. My recommendation: unless you are already prepared to shut everything down, do not do this.</p>
<p>The most likely outcome is radio silence from all your recipients with an occasional "thanks, but no thanks".</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Bidding War</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>On the other extreme, you are approached by more than one strategic acquirer with an unsolicited offer you cannot refuse and a light due diligence requirement. This is the perfect time to hire a banker and run a process. The banker would selectively analyze companies in or adjacent to your space that have the bankroll to outbid your existing offer.</p>
<p>Based on my conversations with founders in similar situations, they all appreciated having a banker manage the process. In the case of Wattpad, CEO Allen Lau hired bankers when they received their first offer. They discovered two additional companies that put in offers. All three arrived at nearly the same price in the end.</p>
<p>Unless you are in either situation, do not run a process. Setting an artificial timeline forces acquiring companies to make a decision on whether to pursue an acquisition. This should only be done when you have leverage. Since the first scenario will likely end in a trainwreck regardless, it's best to discover whether you have leverage without setting a timeline.</p>
<p>No executive feels comfortable engaging in M&A conversations without adequately knowing and trusting you. Stay patient. Engage in conversations individually. Don't set a deadline. Let the interactions grow organically. Apply pressure later in the conversations, not now.</p>
