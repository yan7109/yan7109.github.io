  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>When companies fail, it's more often from implosions than explosions. This is even more true during an exit, where the stakes are higher and everyone has different expectations for what counts as an acceptable outcome. Everyone involved needs to be on the same page going into an M&amp;A and throughout the process. Disputes can jeopardize a deal. They can also kill the company.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is a trial by fire that tests your closest relationships. Not all of them will make it to the other side. You may not even see the other side at all.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Spouse</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>In my case, the most important person to get on the same page with before deciding to explore an exit was my wife. Perhaps it's the same for you. Charis was supportive throughout the years, from the founding of Polarr all the way to the M&amp;A. When I made the decision to sell, we had a one year old and a baby on the way. We never explicitly discussed the company's future and exit plan together. But when I told her I was going to explore selling the company, I could feel a sigh of relief. There was finally going to be some predictability. Maybe even a sense of normalcy after years of hard work.</p>
<p>Beyond supporting the decision to sell, she also made it clear that she had no expectations for any payout from the exit. I don't know how normal this is in other marriages. But because Charis also worked and consistently made much more money than I did in big tech, her stoicism and the stability of her income freed me from additional pressure to land the company.</p>
<p>Some of the loneliest times I ever felt were during the M&amp;A. Nothing was working. I was on the brink of throwing in the towel and walking away from it all. There were days when I became completely insufferable. The tiniest inconvenience would trigger a complete meltdown. That's what M&amp;A did to me. It was impossible not to be emotional when the stakes were so high and the margins of error were so small.</p>
<p>Charis was my bedrock throughout that entire time. For things I couldn't talk to my cofounder, my board, or my team about, I talked to Charis. She was my sounding board and kept me grounded. It would've been a whole lot harder to go through this process alone.</p>
<p>My cofounder Borui planned on marrying his longtime girlfriend in 2024 and starting a family. They broke up that same year, three years into our M&amp;A journey. I don't know how much of a toll M&amp;A had on their relationship. But I know he went through similar episodes of intense emotional ups and downs. One minute we expected the deal to close. The next, we were told they were no longer interested. Most of the time was spent waiting for a response or preparing for some make-or-break meeting with the potential buyer.</p>
<p>Borui was a lot less emotional than me. He did a much better job compartmentalizing different areas of his life. He rarely let work get to him or lost his cool. But still, M&amp;A was a different beast from running a company.</p>
<p>A few words of caution about alignment with your significant other when going through this. Be transparent, but set the expectation that things will be harder than ever. If you act rashly, the context is that you are going through an M&amp;A. Be quick to listen and slow to judge. Take a deep breath before reacting.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Cofounders</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The cofounder relationship is one of the trickiest to protect before and during an acquisition. There's a natural power dynamic when founders have an unequal equity split. The person with more shares gets more voting power when accepting or rejecting a deal. This is rarely an issue when the terms are favorable and the returns are big. But it gets contentious when the deal is small or doesn't clear the preference stack.</p>
<p>At Polarr, this dynamic existed. Borui owned about 33% of the company while I owned 7%. If the deal barely cleared the preference stack, say there was $6 million in proceeds after paying out the investors, Borui would walk away with nearly four times more than me. That didn't feel fair given the amount of effort we both put into building and preparing the company for an exit.</p>
<p>There was another dynamic too. Because Borui had more ownership and no family or liquidation pressure, he had more reason to keep building the company if no buyer was found. I would face a different choice: break the bank to exercise my vested options, or walk away with nothing.</p>
<p>We had a series of conversations about how to fairly divide the proceeds. They were probably the toughest but most important conversations for setting expectations and getting aligned. Here's what you need to understand: for most M&amp;As, especially when the acquiring company wants to keep the team, the deal needs buy-in from all cofounders who are still working there and have significant ownership. So we agreed to come up with a structure that felt fair to both of us. Here are some practical guidelines from our experience.</p>
<p>On the unequal equity split, we agreed it wasn't worth fighting over. Changing it would require board approvals and lawyers drafting new vesting schedules. Even though we had a large option pool, our vested shares still dwarfed the pool. Issuing additional shares just to settle scores wouldn't be smart.</p>
<p>We agreed that if the closing deal cleared the preference stack, we would follow the existing waterfall structure. Borui would get a much larger return from his ownership. But M&amp;A proceeds typically have two parts: considerations (cash or stock paid upfront) and retention (cash and stock paid after the acquisition). My ask was that my retention amount needed to make up the difference in closing considerations. This would still need approval from the acquiring company. But at least we had alignment on a structure we could both sign and commit to.</p>
<p>That was the easy part. The harder discussion was what would happen when the deal didn't clear the preference stack. In that scenario, common shares get wiped out and Borui and I would receive nothing from our equity. A buyer would still put together a retention package for the team. But how would that get divided? Should equity still matter?</p>
<p>We had heated debates about this. My argument was that retention should reflect how important each person is to the acquiring company, not the cap table. The cap table would be underwater and meaningless if the preference stack wasn't cleared. Borui's argument was that the cap table still served as a proxy for each person's value. I was grateful that Borui eventually agreed with me. Since both of us would play equally important roles in the integration after the deal, we should get equal retention if the preference stack wasn't cleared.</p>
<p>The final numbers when we sold in 2025 were slightly different from what we originally agreed on. I made some concessions on closing proceeds because I had been paid more than Borui since our Series A in 2019 due to my growing family. Borui took a higher signing bonus based on those salary differences over the years. But those early alignment conversations served as the foundation for how the proceeds should be divided. When we finally got down to the numbers, the discussion was smooth. Neither of us was surprised by where the other stood. I was thankful we had those heated debates before and during the M&amp;A process. They aligned us toward getting a deal done that both of us could be content with.</p>
<p>The thing to avoid is not telling each other how you feel about how the money should be split. Or worse, surprising each other with demands when the deal is ready to be signed. These issues don't come up when the returns are huge and everyone walks away a millionaire. But most acquisition deals don't generate outsized returns, if they generate any at all. It's important to set expectations for those cases with your cofounders.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Board of Directors</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Most of the time the board is made up of cofounders and major investors, and sometimes independent directors. The board has a fiduciary duty to all shareholders. That's the highest level of care and loyalty in the best interest of the company. In early stage startups, the founder/CEO reports to the board, and the board has the power to fire the CEO.</p>
<p>For Polarr, the board members were Borui, myself, Heidi Roizen of Threshold Ventures, Mar Hershenson of Pear VC, and Bangaly Kaba who was independent. When an acquisition inquiry or offer comes in, it's the CEO's duty to report it to the board and get input before acting. The CEO doesn't have to follow the board's directives, especially if board members don't hold a majority of the stock. But you still need to inform the board of any developments and keep them in the loop.</p>
<p>We made the rookie mistake initially when a big pre-IPO company reached out with an acquisition inquiry where we forgot to immediately let the board members and advisors know of the engagement. This was a big no-no, and could be grounds for breach of fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>At the end of 2021 when Borui and I decided it was time to sell, we spoke to each board member individually before an upcoming board meeting. We told everyone our rationale: there were a good number of inbound inquiries and we wanted an exit. Both Heidi and Mar were supportive, but also gave us the lay of the land. It wasn't going to be easy even though we thought we had actionable inbound interest. They didn't say what their expectations were from the sale. Both were former entrepreneurs and probably had the foresight that an exit would be difficult. Still, they signed off on the plan for us to bring on bankers and begin exploring M&amp;A.</p>
<p>The best advice I got from an advisor during this time was that an exit didn't have to be our only option. She suggested that since we had healthy cash flow, lots of cash in the bank, and a lean team, we could buy out the preferred shares. Then we could keep operating the business or pivot into something else. In retrospect, this could have helped us in the M&amp;A market. A cleaner cap table with no investors in the mix could attract more buyers since there would be less friction to complete a deal. But it could also invite bad actors trying to get us to accept lowball offers when there are no adults in the room.</p>
<p>I was glad we had a board that was involved every step of the way. They weren't part of the outreach or conversations with potential buyers. But they connected us with the right bankers and advisors, and we leaned on them heavily during this time.</p>
<p>There were two other ways this board conversation could have gone. In one extreme, if the company was burning cash, had no traction, and very short runway left, the board would have told us to wind down gracefully to minimize litigation risks. Pursuing M&amp;A under those circumstances would be unlikely. At the very least, major restructuring or layoffs would need to happen first to extend the runway.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, if the company was doing really well, growing like crazy, and the founders asked to explore selling, the board would naturally question the rationale. They might opt to change the CEO and executive team instead. Unless the acquisition offer provides a return that is tens or hundreds of times the initial investment, the board would likely recommend continuing to operate independently, with or without you running the business.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Investors Outside of the Board</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Nothing needs to be disclosed to investors outside the board at this stage. Most of the time, small investors follow the lead investor and no action is needed. Informing them early about M&amp;A activities would be a distraction. They'll want to know the likely returns and the impact on their portfolio and tax situation. The bottom line is nobody knows what's going to happen, especially this early.</p>
<p>The right time to inform them is when a term sheet is signed. At that point, share the terms and answer their questions. Unless it's a full stock purchase, which needs every shareholder's approval, you typically only need a majority to approve a deal. Your lawyers will recommend getting approvals from all shareholders. But you only need the majority. Make sure the major shareholders are well-informed and on board, and the deal can get signed off.</p>
<p>Don't purposefully withhold this information from outside investors either. If you have regular check-ins with them, it's fine to let them know you're exploring a sale and ask for guidance. Sometimes these conversations lead somewhere unexpected. They may introduce you to the right bankers or connect you with an interested party. Just avoid setting expectations on the actual sale terms.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Key Employees</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Every situation is different. But the general rule is: don't inform the team about pending M&amp;A activities. In most cases, deals don't happen and the disclosure causes lasting damage to trust and morale. When you start engaging with potential buyers, the company still needs to run well. Giving the team this information is a huge distraction. Every interaction with a buyer triggers questions that need answers. And the information you have is usually just a snapshot from your point of contact at the potential buyer. Nobody can read the tea leaves until there's a signed agreement with terms spelled out.</p>
<p>The mistake we made was disclosing M&amp;A activities to the entire team. This wasn't done carelessly. We had two reasons.</p>
<p>First, we were in the middle of a failed pivot toward a social product. It had very little traction and was extremely costly to develop. The strategy wasn't working. We needed another layoff in mid-2021, having just done one in early 2020. The logical move was to double down on products that were generating revenue and look for a buyer. We felt it was unfair to announce layoffs and a pivot without the full context. We also feared that mass attrition and a loss of confidence would kill the company.</p>
<p>Second, we had inbound interest from several companies that would pull Borui and me away for meetings and prep work. We wanted to be transparent with the team about why we wouldn't be reachable during work hours.</p>
<p>We also put a retention bonus in place, funded from our existing cash balance, to keep key employees through the M&amp;A. We earmarked $377,000 to be paid out on May 31, 2023 or when the company was sold, whichever came first. We communicated this along with the M&amp;A news and the workforce reduction in April 2022. It got the team refocused on core products. We saw no turnover for nearly two years.</p>
<p>Looking back, the retention bonus wasn't without issues. We didn't sell by May 2023. We had been way too bullish. After the bonus paid out, we saw voluntary turnover in 2023. Worse, during due diligence with buyers, the one-time payout was scrutinized. It signaled that we intended to sell, which reduced our leverage. No strong offer came as a result.</p>
<p>In retrospect, we should have just told the team we were reorienting back to products that made money and left out the M&amp;A part. Or at least, we should have thought harder about what happens when the retention deadline arrives and the company hasn't sold. That would have reduced the pressure we faced and put the company in a better position.</p>
<p>The benefit of being fully transparent was that the team took clear ownership. Even though Borui and I were unreachable for most of the working hours, the team operated independently on product and engineering goals. They didn't need input from us.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Other Equity Holders</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>We also had ex-cofounders who held meaningful shares and past employees who exercised their shares when they left. In an M&amp;A, you don't need input from this group unless it's a full stock purchase deal, where every shareholder needs to approve the sale. That's rarely the case. No communications need to be made to this group until a deal is about to close. Even then, a shareholder vote only requires a majority depending on the company bylaw, and most likely their votes won't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to watch out for is documentation. Make sure the discovery and engagement with potential buyers are fully documented. Disgruntled ex-employees or ex-cofounders may litigate, claiming they didn't receive rightful returns from their shares. Maybe they think the company sold too cheaply. Or maybe they just didn't leave on good terms. This didn't happen to us. But I've heard many stories from founder friends whose ex-cofounders or ex-employees blocked M&amp;A deals for legitimate concerns or frivolous reasons. If you foresee blowback from former employees, bring on a reputable law firm early so everything is documented and done within the bounds of the law.</p>
<p>You may never reach perfect alignment across all stakeholders during an M&amp;A. Even when a deal closes, there may be people or firms you never want to talk to again. The lesson is that we are all humans first. We have our own needs, wants, and insecurities. Treat each other with empathy. Try to help others even if it means going out of your way. People rarely remember exactly how much money they gained or lost from a deal. But they will always remember how you treated them.</p>
</div>
<p>Now that shareholder alignment is covered, let's look at other areas of the business you need to work on before an M&amp;A.</p>
