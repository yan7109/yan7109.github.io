  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>The time you spent meeting potential acquirers and doing due diligence is never wasted, even when you get no offers. As long as you weren't the only person talking in those meetings, you picked up valuable insights. Sometimes the signal is explicit: "This is an area where we're spending a lot of resources and could use help." That's a direct clue to position your company as the solution. Other times the signal is subtle. The acquirer leans in and asks more questions about a particular product, or requests extra materials on a specific topic. All of this is useful as you go back to the drawing board and build the next version of your product and strategy.</p>
<p>You also have to separate what you can control from what you can't. Focus your time and resources on what you can control. That's what will improve your chances next time.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Things You Can't Control</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>1. Market Conditions: The market is the market. It shifts with macroeconomics, regulatory policies, central bank decisions, and investor sentiment. A vertical that was once the darling of Sand Hill Road can get abandoned overnight because something shinier came along. You can't control this. Don't waste money trying to create a market that doesn't exist. PR firms will happily take your money for blitz campaigns, but they probably won't move the needle.</p>
<p>2. Acquirer Strategies: Buying a company has to be the acquirer's idea. You can never engineer a sale as a seller. Think about the last time you bought anything from a cold call. As the Red Little Book of Selling says, "People love to buy, but hate to be sold." Don't expect a target acquirer to change their strategy just because your company is available. That shift always comes from within.</p>
<p>3. Regulatory Shifts: Government policies on subsidies, grants, or immigration can have a huge impact on your startup's fortune. But you have very little control over them. Be adaptable. Work with the policies instead of spending your time lobbying politicians or gathering signatures.</p>
<p>4. Executive Turnovers: M&amp;A is a relationship business. Decisions are made by people. People leave and join companies all the time. When your internal champion leaves the acquiring company, the deal will likely die. You can try to find the next person in line to sponsor you, but it often means starting over.</p>
<p>5. Acquirer Culture: Don't expect to change the acquirer's culture. If a deal happens, your team will be expected to adapt to theirs. This is why cultural diligence is such a big part of the process. Even if combining forces makes perfect strategic sense, savvy acquirers will pass if there's a cultural mismatch. Cultural clashes lead to conflicts and deeper divides down the road.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Things You Can Control</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>1. Your Product Roadmap: You always have control over what you work on. Companies evolve and pivot all the time. Just because you struck out doesn't mean you have to keep building the same thing. Take the feedback from the market and focus on what potential acquirers responded to.</p>
<p>When we struck out in late 2022, the market told us the persona we were serving wasn't appealing. Everyone wanted the professional audience. Acquirers liked our technology stack, but we needed to build for customers with higher lifetime values. So starting in 2023, we pivoted to a brand new product for professional photographers. That pivot is what got us a term sheet in 2024 and an acquisition in 2025.</p>
<p>2. Your Resource Allocations: Desperate times call for desperate measures. If you're still spending time and money on products that don't appeal to the M&amp;A market, ask yourself why. It's never too late to stop working on something. Beware the sunk cost fallacy. Never throw good money after bad.</p>
<p>3. Quality of Your Narrative: One reason you're not getting offers might be your pitch. You may be too stubborn about your vision. You may be missing cues from acquirers about what they want the combined company to work on. Remember, the acquirer wants you to solve their problem. They don't care about your vision and mission the way you do. Get feedback on your pitch from board members and advisors. Be flexible when questions come up about the joint mission.</p>
<p>4. Team Morale: Your team looks to you for direction and energy. No matter how tough the M&amp;A market is, don't let the negative energy seep into the team. They should keep building and focusing on customers. It rarely helps to prematurely tell the team about M&amp;A prospects. Employees will immediately wonder about job security and whether the company is about to disappear. Go about each day normally. Keep the M&amp;A process to yourself.</p>
<p>5. Personal Resilience and Mental Health: Getting a bad offer is normal. Getting no offers is even more common. It doesn't mean you failed as a founder. It shouldn't affect your identity or values. Go about each day doing your best. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. You will be a better founder, executive, and person on the other side.</p>
<p>Exercise. Eat well. Be part of a community. Catch up with the family and friends you've neglected. Know that you are loved and valued. And be grateful. Be grateful you still have the freedom to choose what you do. There are always worse situations. It will get better. In a year or two, you'll look back and say, "I'm glad I stuck it through."</p>
<p>6. How You Spend Your Time: While we waited on offers from a couple of longshot acquirers after everyone else had passed, I was completely depressed. Some days I wandered aimlessly, unsure what to work on. Every time I tried to code, write, or learn something new, I'd freeze. Then I'd fall into my vices: scrolling endlessly on the internet or playing chess on Chess.com for hours. I'd feel even worse afterward, knowing I'd wasted time.</p>
<p>To pull myself out, I deleted the chess app and set daily goals for exercise, reading, and one specific accomplishment. That's how I got through. But in hindsight, the right expectation was that no deal was coming. We should have kept building products as the primary goal. M&amp;A tasks should be supplemental to the day-to-day work of running the company.</p>
