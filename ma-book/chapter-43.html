    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 43</span>Term Sheet Signed, Start of a Thousand Paper Cuts</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Congratulations, you have signed the term sheet and entered into an exclusive no-shop period with the potential acquirer. You exchange pleasantries with your future boss and chat about how exciting the shared future looks. Everyone is optimistic for a fast close and looking forward to working on the joint roadmap and drafting a press release.

I can't stress this enough: the communication should be optimistically cautious. The deal could still fall apart. Nothing is guaranteed until the money is wired to the bank. Brace yourself. This is the beginning of a thousand papercuts. Let's first look at the interactions with the key stakeholders and how to work through them in the next phase of negotiations.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Key Stakeholder Management</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p class="sub-header">1. Cofounders</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Up to this point, chances are that your relationship with your cofounders is tight and encouraging. You have been on the same page about getting to a term sheet and seeing the company land. But as soon as a term sheet is produced and signed, questions come up. The key terms are still in broad brush strokes. Founders start asking how to divide up the payout, what types of roles are acceptable, and how personal risks like reps &amp; warranties or non-competes hit one founder harder than the other.

It is critical that you and your cofounders are fully in sync and work in complete harmony to close the deal. Any fragmentation or acrimony that spills over to the buyer can spook them and call off the deal.</p>
<p>In the ideal case, the considerations clear the preference stacks by a mile. The result is a home-run outcome for the founders and early employees. The conversation becomes easy. Liquidation follows through the cap table waterfall. You and your cofounders get paid accordingly.

The retention at this point serves as an equalizer. It incentivizes key employees who would likely cash out and leave on day 1 without enough retention rewards, and those who have little upside from the sale but are still critical to the integration. You and your cofounders simply need to agree on who those employees are and make the recommendation to the buyer.</p>
<p>The conversation gets very difficult when the headline price does not clear or barely clears the preference stack. The common stock holders are wiped out completely. Even the investors take a loss after the lawyers and bankers get paid. The only source of compensation from this transaction for the founders comes from the buyer retention pool and potentially a carve-out from your board if they are nice. I will cover carve-outs in the next section.</p>
<p>The cap table at this point plays almost no role in how the retention pool is divided among founders and employees. In the eyes of the buyer, it is simply a function of the retained employee's domain knowledge and replacement cost. Even though a cofounder may have owned an outsized number of shares, if she does not serve a critical role in the integration, the buyer would not sign off on her getting the lion's share of the retention bonus. The retention allocation needs to be approved by the acquirer almost all the time.

I am well aware that each founder may feel that her contribution is more significant than the rest. I recommend proposing an even split among the founders for the retention pool. The founders receive anywhere between 50% to 80% of the total retention. The rest of the team receives the remaining 50% to 20% depending on team size. Bigger the team, bigger the allocation.

An even split between the founders spells out a united front when negotiating with the buyers, as long as every founder is staying for the entire retention period. This leaves nobody's ego bruised and shows that every founder pulls her own weight in the acquisition.</p>
<p>Your biggest allies in this entire transaction are your cofounders. By the same token, if anybody could destroy the deal, it would also be your cofounders. As difficult as it may be, put the needs of your cofounders as high as your own. Compromise and come up with an outcome that everybody feels good about. Chances are, this won't be your last company together.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Board of Directors</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Before signing the term sheet, it is customary to send over the final redlined version to your board for approval. This is not required because the term sheet is non-binding. But it is critical to be on the same page with your board throughout this process.

Your board of directors likely includes your lead investors. They have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. During a M&amp;A, this means overseeing a due process of discovery, finding the best possible deal, and ensuring that all the necessary counsel and precautions are in place.</p>
<p>There are two sources of potential conflict with your board at this point.

First is the allocation of considerations versus retention. The buyer would much prefer a deal where not a single cent is paid out to the investors or ex-employees on the cap table. They want all the cash spent on the retained team to incentivize a successful integration. This is a conflict with fiduciary duty, as shareholders include investors and people who are no longer working at the company.

This is less likely to be contentious if the considerations are well above the preference stack and everyone is swimming in the upside. There could still be board members who expect an outsized return on investment and have veto rights that can block the deal. The work should have been done at the beginning to set expectations so that there are no surprises at this point.

When the consideration barely clears or does not clear the preference stack, a balancing act is needed. The investors still need some returns and the team still needs motivation to complete the deal. Imagine a scenario where the upside for the team is zero and all the money goes to the preferred shareholders. The founders would not sign off. The opportunity cost of joining the acquirer would be greater than just seeking employment in the job market or starting a new company.

Experienced board members would instead offer a management carveout, typically in the 5-10% range of the total proceeds the investor would receive. This goes to the founders and key employees as extra motivation to ride out the deal. How this money is divided is largely at the discretion of the founders. My advice is the same as the last section: treat others the way you want to be treated.

If a management carve-out is offered by your board, this information needs to be disclosed to the acquirer. The additional incentives will need to be voted on by the board members and would also affect the 280G analysis.

There is also the potential issue of an escrow, where some percentage of the proceeds may be put aside to cover unforeseen lawsuits or expenses post M&amp;A. The size of the escrow directly affects how much distribution investors get at deal close. They all want everything at once. But the buyer may insist on having an escrow to protect the buy-side from potential risks. This is another area to work out with your board.</p>
<p>The second, and perhaps bigger, area of contention is the cap on indemnifications and reps and warranties. When a company is sold, the board typically dissolves. Board members want to move on with their lives. The last thing they want is an unlimited cap on indemnifications where a future lawsuit wipes out all of the upside plus some.

Your board would not sign off on deals with these types of terms. It is critical to have your lawyers flag anything that puts your board members at risk in the definitive agreement. This also means that you and your cofounders may have to front some of the risks personally when it comes to indemnifications and reps and warranties. Do not be surprised if your retention bonuses are used to backstop future lawsuits so that your investors are off the hook.</p>
<p>Outside of these two areas, board members are typically empathetic as long as you ran a clean process and they were all informed along the way. But you want unanimous board approval on the actual deal terms.

While only a majority is needed to pass a resolution, having even one board member dissent could lead to litigation risks. The buyer may have low confidence that the deal can get through. Sometimes buyers put unanimous board approval into the closing condition to limit their exposure to such risks. Dissenting board members could also leak critical deal information, or go rogue and try to sabotage the deal.

Spend the time to meet each board member individually and understand their needs. This way you will not have any surprises when it comes time for the actual vote. Start providing weekly email updates to your board at this point and keep them informed on the latest progress leading up to close.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Outside Investors</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>If you onboarded many outside investors throughout the lifetime of the company, most of them will not have a board seat or even an observer seat. They have very little visibility into the M&amp;A process. If you have not informed them on the potential exit, now is the time.

Failure to inform them could cause a hold up during the actual shareholder approval process. It could even lead to litigation if these outside investors feel that the board did not fulfill their fiduciary duty in finding the best possible deal. To approve a M&amp;A (not a share purchase), only fifty percent of the shares need to vote yes. The main thing these investors would care about is what the waterfall looks like with the agreed upon headline considerations. What would they get at close, cash or stocks, and how much.</p>
<p>Non-board member investors typically behave in two distinct ways when it comes to M&amp;A.

The vast majority of institutional investors in Silicon Valley vote in the same direction as the lead investors, who are typically board members. They either led the last round of financing or owned the majority of shares outside of founders. The reason is simple. Institutional investors are friends and share a very tight network. It's not uncommon for partners to switch firms or start their own funds. Being a naysayer when the lead investor already approved the deal could signal the dissenter as difficult to work with and hurt access to future co-investment opportunities. If you took investment from institutional investors on Sand Hill Road, the work is already done as soon as the lead investors are onboard.</p>
<p>Then there is the other class of non-institutional investors. Family offices, internet celebrities, early advisors, rich uncles, wealthy friends who do not have large ownerships of the company but still hold preferred shares. These investors do not follow the unwritten rules of Silicon Valley, and could be a potential holdout for the deal.

For one, they may not be as responsive as institutional investors. You may not even get their signatures in time for a fast close. And if they do have an issue with the transaction, it's most likely because they hold unrealistic expectations on what the return multiple should be. This is where having good prior investor relations helps. Even the smallest investors should be in the loop with company financials and latest strategies.

If you find yourself in a pickle where an investor of this class is not replying to your emails, dragging their feet, or flat out belligerent with the top line deal terms, first analyze if you have the necessary votes to pass the deal. If so, be courteous and try to address their concerns. But also make it clear that this deal already has the necessary votes.

If you do need their votes to approve the deal, you will need to make sure the demands are met by renegotiating the terms with the buyer and the board. Reach out to your lead investors for help providing additional context or mending the relationship. Sometimes having the same news delivered by a fellow investor instead of a founder is easier to swallow.

The deal is not closing imminently. You still have time to get everybody on board. Spend the time to meet, explain, and align with all your investors on the upcoming transaction. You want to make sure that everyone will sign the definitive agreement a couple months later when the deal is about to close.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of 280G analysis down the road. If you and your cofounders and key executives receive compensation from the transaction that significantly exceeds typical pay, the compensation package gets put under a vote by all shareholders excluding those who would be receiving such pay. Guess what. Those investors who were holding out the deal in the first place could block the vote once again. A failure to pass the 280G vote means an additional 20% excise tax for all the recipients.

I will talk more about 280G in a later chapter. The point is: be on good terms with all your shareholders. Dissenters can do serious damage to the deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Shareholders with Significant Ownership</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>There is a class of shareholders who hold common stocks accounting for more than 1% of the company but are neither investors nor employees. Most likely they are your ex-cofounders or ex-employees who have left the company. Their shares are unlikely to sway the shareholder vote one way or another. But their vote could be the deciding vote when it comes to the 280G.

Ideally the deal clears the preference stack and these shareholders also have some upside. They are less likely to turn adversarial. Still, now is the time to tally the cap table and figure out if there could be a potential issue with any of the upcoming votes. Proactively reach out to those individuals, give them the lay of the land, and answer any questions they may have.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Other Shareholders on the Cap Table</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>No communication needs to be done to folks in this category at this point. They will find out about the deal during the final approval process.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Employees</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>As much as you would like to share the news with your employees, I would advise you to hold off until the deal becomes a certainty. Your employees do not have half the context that you have on the M&amp;A. They will not be able to stomach a failed deal as well as you do. You do not want all your subsequent interactions with them to always be about the M&amp;A. Plus, the term sheet may even forbid you from discussing its existence with anyone outside of your board, officers, lawyers, bankers, and accountants.</p>
<p>If you must, any communications that involve the potential buyer should be on a need-to-know basis and only in the context that's necessary for the due diligence. For instance, if a confirmatory due diligence needs to be done in engineering that requires key engineers to be present, have them sign an NDA and then loop them in with only what's needed for the meeting. Something along the lines of company X is looking to do some deep integration with us, and would like to run a technical review on the area that you are responsible for. That's it, no need to talk about anything else. If they ask follow up questions, simply tell them that you can't tell them much at this point.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">7. Bankers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>If you have the luxury of affording bankers, they should have done the heavy lifting of getting the term sheet. They will help you navigate the rest of the process and get the deal to a close.

But understand that incentives don't always match between you and the bankers. Your goal is to find the best place to spend the next few years. You want to work on a joint venture, grow your business together, and develop your career. This would mean negotiating hard on titles, areas of responsibility, or even walking away from a deal if the vision doesn't match.

Your bankers, on the other hand, are mainly driven by the financial incentives of closing the deal at the best possible headline price and retention bonus with the least amount of risk. They will be more risk-averse than you when it comes to negotiating terms that could jeopardize the deal. They won't work as hard on terms outside of retentions and considerations. They would even nudge you to take a safe deal rather than pressing on with an ultimatum that threatens walking away.</p>
<p>The bankers we hired were not these types of hustlers. But many founders aren't as fortunate. Set clear expectations with your bankers on what you are looking for in the deal. They are working for you. No deal is done without you agreeing. Keep a close pulse with your point of contact from the acquirer, and don't be afraid to step in to steer your bankers even though they may still be doing the negotiations on your behalf.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">8. Lawyers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Whenever a company goes through a M&amp;A, especially on the sell side, the lawyers get to have a field day. This is likely the last invoice your lawyers will bill you. Expect their team of partners and associates to step in and bill hours for reviewing anything and everything about the lifetime of the company.

The majority of the work will be done by the acquiring counsel. They provide the initial draft of the definitive agreement, requests for various disclosures, and manage the closing process. Your lawyers will need to step in to redline and negotiate on the company's behalf, prepare the final disclosures, and manage the close process from your end. That includes getting board and stockholder approvals and running the 280G analysis.</p>
<p>The biggest potential money drain is in preparation of the disclosures. Align with the buyer on a tight list of items to disclose that are material to the transaction. That could include your key customer contracts, critical intellectual properties, employment contracts, legal documents, and tax filings. Things that may not be material could include vendor contracts below $10,000 a year, open source software usage, or existing employee health insurance plans.

All of these documents will be read through by the lawyers on both sides. This could easily turn into an endless discovery process where lawyers flag random items that require further clarifications or supporting documents. Don't let them play this game with you. Each email exchange and additional disclosure schedule they draft will be billed as hours.</p>
<p>Another potential money drain is overly zealous lawyers being aggressive with terms in the final agreement. While it’s helpful to have a strong and knowledgeable legal presence, you have to set the expectations on materiality with respect to only negotiating on terms that matter.</p>
<p>Here are some techniques to help you stay on budget. Not everything needs to go through your lawyers. Reviewing new employment contracts from the buyer, preparing the disclosure schedules, even negotiating key terms can all be done by you. The lawyers sometimes are only needed to put the final language in legal terms.

Set a budget and review the billable hours regularly. If at any time you feel like the lawyers are spinning their wheels and not making progress, bring the matter directly to the buyer. Get agreement first and have the lawyers put it on paper.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Final Interviews</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The buyer may require a final round of interviews with some or all of your employees before deal closing. If no team interviews have been conducted yet, refer back to the Key Employee Interviews chapter on how to prepare your team. If interviews and technical due diligence have already been completed, this round mainly serves the purposes of cultural fit and retention assessment.

This also means you will need to disclose to those being interviewed that there is a potential offer in place for the company. Manage expectations. Tell your employees that there are still a number of big ticket items to be completed, and there is no guarantee that the deal will close even if everyone aces the interview.</p>
<p>The acquiring executive or HR will ask whether your employee is excited to join the acquiring company, and may implicitly get this information by asking how much they already know about the company and what they think a joint strategy would look like. Your employees may also get asked what their day-to-day function looks like, and assess how critical they are for the acquisition. Certain roles may get eliminated based on redundancies, lack of impact, and cost constraints.</p>
<p>It is still critical to prepare your team and run mock interviews. Ideally you have a great culture and everyone is on the same page. But you may still have disgruntled, unmotivated, or underqualified employees who should not be part of the interview process. Terminate those relationships early. Having them strung along could cause serious damage to the deal.

Imagine what your acquirer will think if your star engineer told them in the interview that she hates working for you. Or has no desire to work for the acquiring company. Or has not written any code for the last year. A single bad interview could kill the deal.</p>
<p>It is bizarre, but some employees start to act out of character upon finding out that the company is going through an M&amp;A. People don't know how to react when they face the potential of either making a lot of money or being laid off because they don't get to be retained by the acquirer. That's why it is better to communicate this to the team when the context is clear and the decision is already made.

For the employees in the privileged circle who you had to share the news with, spend extra effort and attention managing their day-to-days. Give them ample opportunities to ask questions and talk through their concerns.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Confirmatory Due Diligence</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>At this point, the acquiring lawyers will be deep in your data room, HR combing through your past performance reviews and internal docs, accountants scrutinizing over your bank statements and budget for the last three years, and senior engineers reading through your code base. You should already have done some level of due diligence, but if not, please refer back to the chapter on Initial Due Diligence.</p>
<p>If you have weekly check-ins scheduled with your main point person from the acquiring company, expect them to become due diligence calls. Various members of the acquirer team get looped in and ask you questions on different aspects of the business. They could be as trivial as what a line item from your credit card balance a year ago was, whether an ex-employee has returned their company equipment, or why a certain software library is used over another.

Other times, the questions are trickier and require thought. For example, they may ask the likelihood of a major customer renewing their existing contract. Be conservative and provide worst case projections. You don't want to be overly optimistic because your retention bonus could be tied directly to projections. Changes in the company direction post-acquisition could result in that revenue target no longer being a priority. The retention bonus you thought you would get never gets paid out.

At the same time, don't sandbag or cast overly pessimistic projections for future earnings. That could spook the acquirer and lead to a loss in confidence for the acquisition.</p>
<p>As frustrating as this process is, understand that the acquirer needs to ask all these questions. The sponsor of the deal needs to fulfill her duty to her direct manager. Very often the CEO is the sponsor. She has a fiduciary duty to her board and shareholders. She needs to demonstrate rigorous oversight, eliminate blind spots, and ensure full accountability. She has personally championed this deal and needs to justify it, knowing her own reputation and credibility are directly at stake.

The buyer's team might seem overly cautious, even paranoid, as they probe for red flags and hidden risks. They're trying to uncover anything that could later cause embarrassment, financial loss, or operational disruption. The barrage of questions may feel exhausting or intrusive. It's rarely personal. It's a reflection of the buyer's internal pressures and the high stakes involved. Recognizing this context can help you stay patient, transparent, and constructive during this challenging phase.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Disclosure Schedules</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Providing disclosure schedules to the buyer requires careful attention in multiple areas. Start by establishing clear alignment with the buyer on which types of disclosures are truly material to the transaction. Without this clarity, legal teams may expand the scope unnecessarily. That leads to bloated documentation and a longer due diligence timeline. Manage lawyer input proactively to keep disclosures focused, relevant, and manageable.</p>
<p>Precision and honesty matter here more than anywhere else. Each statement in the disclosure schedules should be verified and triple-checked for accuracy. Errors, omissions, or ambiguous statements can become significant liabilities down the line. They can trigger disputes or even litigation. Be especially cautious with consulting agreements, employee compensation agreements, vendor contracts, and software licenses. Inaccuracies in these areas can result in major post-transaction issues.</p>
<p>Watch out for subtle "gotchas" like notice periods or first right of refusal related to liquidation or change of ownership. Certain enterprise contracts give customers the right to terminate if there is a change of ownership, or the right to put an offer in place for an acquisition. Pay special attention to contracts needing assignment or consent from third parties. These can introduce unforeseen complexities.</p>
<p>Intellectual property and data security disclosures require particular vigilance. Highlight any dependencies on third-party datasets, models, or tools. Clarify license terms, commercial limitations, and potential replacement costs. Gaps in formal data privacy practices, such as the absence of internal security policies or regular audits, must be transparently communicated to avoid future compliance disputes or penalties.</p>
<p>Disciplined management of disclosure schedules, with clear buyer agreement and thorough review, is what keeps the deal on track.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. The "Oh Crap" Moment</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Proactive communication matters most when unfavorable business developments occur during the M&amp;A closing period. Losing key customers, significant employee departures, lawsuits, or material contract terminations can all affect the transaction's terms or even its viability. Don't bury such developments within dense disclosure schedules. Communicate them clearly and immediately to the buyer. This openness builds trust, maintains goodwill, and can often help mitigate potential adjustments or even termination of the deal.</p>
<p>I faced this scenario firsthand at Polarr during our acquisition by Pixieset. Upon signing the term sheet, there was a closing condition stipulating that no material adverse change to our business would occur. About a couple months later, I received termination notices not from one but two of our largest enterprise customers, OPPO and Samsung. Together they were responsible for nearly a quarter of our entire revenue.

This news was unsettling because of the potential implications for the transaction. Fortunately, this segment was not central to our future strategy. We had been transparent from the start that this enterprise licensing business would eventually diminish. But the timing was unexpectedly bad, and the two seemingly independent catastrophic events happened simultaneously.</p>
<p>Delivering this news to the Pixieset founders was extremely challenging, but my cofounder Borui and I made the conscious choice to be proactive, honest, and explicit. Alongside communicating the losses clearly, we also presented mitigation strategies. This transparency reinforced the trust we'd cultivated with Pixieset and allowed them to confidently proceed without altering the original deal terms. Despite this positive outcome, the stress of potentially jeopardizing the acquisition showed just how important transparency can be during this sensitive period.</p>
<p>Honesty and proactive communication are always the best choices. They significantly reduce the buyer's perception of risk and uncertainty. Buyers expect some degree of turbulence during the acquisition process. Their confidence in your integrity can carry more weight than the immediate financial impact of negative news.

Discovering hidden problems through diligence can severely damage the buyer's trust. It can cause them to renegotiate terms aggressively or abandon the deal altogether. Being forthcoming demonstrates your good faith and positions you as a reliable partner going into the post-acquisition relationship.</p>
