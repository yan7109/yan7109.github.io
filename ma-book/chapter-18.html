  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>The most important set of documents to prepare before engaging with interested parties is your data room. It's a straightforward collection: capitalization table, incorporation documents, material contracts, employment letters, financial statements, debts, and so on. Things can move fast. You don't want to scramble when a buyer asks for your data room and it's not ready.</p>
<p>The most important document they'll want to see is your cap table with the waterfall for liquidation. This shows who gets how much in a sale. The buyer needs it to make sure the deal is structured so all decision makers can sign off. They'll also use it to understand the relative importance of each employee.</p>
<p>The second most important folder, ideally empty, is legal proceedings. Ongoing legal disputes with any company or individual are the number one reason deals fall apart. Settle these before you begin the process if you can. Either way, include everything in your data room. It's always better to disclose upfront than to have the acquiring team discover it on their own.</p>
<p>You don't need fancy software for your data room. Dropbox or Google Drive is fine. Organize the documents in a clear folder structure. When a company moves into due diligence and asks for your data room, create a copy and send that over. If the acquirer asks for specific items, just add them to the copy.</p>
<p>See appendix for a list of items to be included in your data room.</p>
