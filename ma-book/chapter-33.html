  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>At this point, the only thing between the middle game and the end game is an offer. Both sides have put in a lot of work. But a deal doesn't become real until the price and retention bonuses are agreed on. Some acquirers are eager to lock in exclusivity by issuing a term sheet right away. Others request every bit of information imaginable but are in no hurry to discuss terms. Once initial due diligence wraps up, that's the checkpoint for a term sheet. Ideally, you've run the process in parallel across multiple suitors. They've all done enough diligence that they can issue offers around the same time. You also want to avoid a situation where you pass on early offers while waiting on a slow-moving acquirer, only to end up with nothing. So how do you get all the ducks in a row? Here are some tips for dealing with each type of acquirer:</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Tech Giants</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Companies like Apple, Google, or Meta move at their own pace. Outside pressure rarely changes that, unless your company is the talk of Silicon Valley and Zuckerberg himself is sponsoring the deal. Decisions are made by committees. The delay is usually scheduling. It takes weeks to get all the decision makers in the same room. There is not much you can do to speed this up. The only thing in your control is to check in with your point of contact and respond to every request quickly. Don't delegate requests to your bankers or lawyers. Handle them yourself so they go out promptly and accurately.</p>
<p>Only apply pressure to a tech giant if you have another real offer you're willing to take. Even then, they probably won't speed up, and you'll end up accepting the other offer. And even if the tech giant does come through in time, remember this is not a job offer. The terms are often non-binding. There is still a long road to closing.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario is to engage with tech giants early and give them plenty of time for due diligence. Let them work at their own pace. Once an offer from them feels close, start engaging with other acquirers who will move much faster.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Stragglers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Some acquirers are much smaller than tech giants but move just as slowly on scheduling and responses. It helps to define what "slow" means. In M&amp;A, three months from initial meeting to term sheet is typical. It can take six months or longer. This feels like an eternity compared to how startups normally operate.</p>
<p>The acquiring company has a business to run outside of this deal. As excited as they may be about working together, buying a company does not occupy the same mental space as selling one. The decision to buy almost always requires agreement among the highest-ranking executives.</p>
<p>As long as communication is regular and updates keep coming, give the acquirer the benefit of the doubt, even if it feels like a snail's pace. The worst thing you can do is give the buyer a deadline when you have no competing offers. You'll sound desperate and lose leverage. Check in every two weeks. Let the buyers drive the process.</p>
<p>Only tell a straggler you're moving on if you have a competing offer you're willing to take. Most likely, the straggler won't come through. And even if they do, think twice before accepting. Their slow pace will likely continue from offer acceptance all the way to closing.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Lurkers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Some companies take meetings just to extract information. They're competitors or operate in adjacent markets and have no real desire to make an offer. The telltale signs: the people they send to initial meetings are junior product managers or marketers. They get cagey when you ask what excites them about a potential deal. But they ask very detailed questions about your product roadmaps, metrics, and technology stack.</p>
<p>During market discovery, you have to take every meeting seriously, even with competitors. The best way to protect yourself is to ask for stricter NDA terms and withhold your most sensitive information until terms are agreed. Or better yet, wait until the money is in the bank.</p>
<p>A competitor usually won't spend months on a fishing expedition to extract trade secrets. But if that's the vibe you're getting, push for term alignment early. Set clear expectations that key algorithms or models only get handed over when the deal closes.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Midsize Companies and Startups</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Midsize companies and startups can move much faster in M&amp;A. But they're usually inexperienced at executing deals. Sometimes it's their first acquisition. That inexperience can hurt you in several ways.</p>
<p>First, make sure they can afford the deal. Do as much due diligence on them as they do on you, if not more. Even in an all-stock deal, you still have to pay your lawyers in cash. Lean on your investors and board to scrutinize the acquirer's books.</p>
<p>Second, they may over-promise on timelines. Lawyers need time to draft and review legal documents on both sides. There could be holdups from the board, government, banks, app stores, or cloud providers. So even if you're having regular meetings with their CEO about integrations and strategy, stay skeptical about any promised timelines.</p>
<p>Finally, their due diligence process may be overbearing. They might scrutinize every small financial or legal detail that doesn't matter to the actual deal. When that happens, remind them of the bigger picture. Don't lose sight of why you're doing this: to build something together.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Exploitative Buyers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Some buyers want all your assets, intellectual property, revenue, and core team members without paying a dime. They'll be more excited about the deal than you are. They prey on companies with decent revenue but stalling growth, trying to use their private stock to buy real assets. They'll promise you a fundraising round is imminent, or an IPO is around the corner. In reality, their CEO is on a short leash from the board and is trying anything to boost top-line revenue to keep her job.</p>
<p>Don't fall for this. You're better off staying independent or returning the remaining cash to investors and winding down. That beats giving away your company for nothing while the buyer takes your assets and revenue, fires most of the team, and gives you a pat on the back.</p>
<p>Look for buyers with a track record of growth and hitting their fundraising and revenue goals. If a buyer can only pay with newly issued private stock, that should give you pause. They should be able to secure debt financing based on their revenue and assets. Or if they're hitting their growth targets, they should have no trouble closing a fundraising round first and then buying your company. If they can't do either, you'll most likely be the one holding the bag.</p>
