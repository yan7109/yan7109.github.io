  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>The next conversation the potential buyer will likely have with you is the expectation alignment meeting. The first thing on the list: considerations (cash vs stock), retention, and potentially other incentives. Other items may come up if they are important to the buyer, can kill the deal, or materially change the valuation or terms. One example is work location, if they expect you and your team to relocate.</p>
<p>The main emphasis is on what amount of money or stock it would take for you to sell the company. How should you answer? Let's first understand the basics. There are more complex forms of payment, but most commonly they are purchase-price considerations and retention / stay bonuses:</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Considerations</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This is what you get at the close of the deal. It could be cash, stock, or a blend. If the acquiring company is private, the stock would be illiquid until a liquidation event like an IPO or another M&A. Depending on when their last fundraising was, the valuation could be stale. You also need to discount the value against the risk of a future liquidation event.</p>
<p>If you have raised capital, there is a liquidation preference stack to consider. The preferred gets paid first. Common stock only gets paid after the preference stack is cleared. Model out the scenarios on how much money or stock you would actually get for different consideration amounts.</p>
<p>Cash is almost always preferred. The only exception is if the acquiring company is a high-flying startup with private stock coveted by investors and not available on the public market. Then it may make sense to pick stock over cash. In that case, the acquiring company may ask you your preference.</p>
<p>For blue chip publicly-traded companies, their stock is as good as cash. But there is typically a lock-in period after an M&A, so you can't sell immediately. Factor in a discount for the stock price based on that lock-in.</p>
<p>Sometimes the acquiring company doesn't have enough cash to complete a deal. They will try creative financing: debt financing, a promissory note, or a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). These structures get complicated quickly and can be disastrous for you as the seller.</p>
<p>If the buyer brings up these topics unsolicited, it means they are short on cash. Your alarm bells should go off. Ask yourself whether you are better off staying independent or risk holding the bag when the deal closes.</p>
<p>Finally, when a deal is complete, you will need to pay the lawyers, the bankers, any outstanding debt, and invoices as well. So be sure to factor those in when modeling your payout at closing as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Retention Bonus</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Buyers would much rather pay all the money to the team being retained than pay a dime to others on the cap table who won't be working for the acquirer, like investors or ex-employees who exercised their shares. The logic is simple. The buyer wants to spend the least amount possible, and to them, the money is better spent motivating and incentivizing those who stay.</p>
<p>No investor would agree to this. The deal would not pass a board vote. On the other hand, if there is no retention and the purchase price doesn't clear the preference stack, the founders and employees get nothing. The investors may be happy to take a small loss, but this also wouldn't pass a board vote because the founders wouldn't agree. And the employees wouldn't agree to work for the acquirer.</p>
<p>This is where negotiation matters. You need to find a sweet spot between considerations and retention where all parties are motivated to take the deal.</p>
<p>The buyer typically offers a two to four year retention bonus to incentivize everyone to stay through the integration. One important difference: retention is treated as ordinary income and subject to a higher tax withholding. Stock purchased at closing is treated as capital gain, as long as the stocks were exercised and held for more than a year.</p>
<p>Sometimes the buyer pushes for a performance-based bonus structure, also known as an earnout. This means the team only gets paid when certain sales targets or milestones are met. Avoid this. Not just because it's unfriendly to the team. Markets change and strategies shift. You never want your incentives tied to a target set years ago when the company has already abandoned that strategy and moved on to something else.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered considerations and retention, how do you answer the expectation question? Your answer depends on how much leverage you have. The buyer will scrutinize your balance sheet, P&L, and fundraising history. They may pencil in a valuation from their analysis. But everything in an M&A is a negotiation. A deal cannot close unless you, your cofounders, and your board agree on the price.</p>
<p>Let's look at how to answer the expectation question based on your scenario, which dictates your leverage.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">1. Competing M&amp;A Offers.</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Tell the acquirer that you have competing offers and they should put their best offer forward. Do not disclose who else you are talking to. Do not tell them what the best offer is until they have provided a number themselves.</p>
<p>If you give a number too early, you may leave money on the table. The buyer may be willing to offer much more. Or it sends the wrong signal that your number is what it takes to close. Don't get into negotiations at this point, even if they provide a number. Thank them, tell them you'll discuss the proposal with the board, and defer negotiations to later.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. No Competing M&amp;A Offers, But Have Investment Offers.</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Similar to the first scenario. Let the acquirer know you have a pending fundraising offer. The purchase price would be much higher once you sign that term sheet. Politely ask them to put their best offer forward and you'll discuss the proposal with your board. Don't offer any numbers.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. No Offers, But Comfortable to Continue Staying Independent.</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Let the acquirer know you are excited about working together, but the company is doing well. You are comfortable running independently and have full support from your board and team. They would need to put together a strong offer to be considered. Again, don't provide a number.</p>
<p>But if they insist on a headline price, use your models and come up with a ceiling that you would be comfortable with if the final sale price is half of that quote. Say your absolute minimum is $10 million at closing and $6 million for retention. Then tell them you are looking for $20 million at close and $12 million for retention.</p>
<p>Once you give numbers, the actual payout will always be less than or equal to what you quoted. It doesn't matter if the company hits bigger milestones or lands new customers after that conversation. Think carefully before providing a number.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. No Offers, No Desires to Stay Independent.</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This is the case where you have no leverage and would take any offer. But that's not true. Think about how much you would get paid in the open market and the freedom to pick your next job or project. You can always put a price on that.</p>
<p>Tell the acquirer you are excited about working together and want to hear what offer they have in mind. You want to make sure the offer takes care of the team, keeps everyone motivated during integration, and is also a good outcome for the investors. Ask them to put together their best offer. If pressed for a number, calculate the opportunity cost of working for the acquiring company for two to three years, multiply by two, and work that into the considerations or retention.</p>
<p>I don't believe it's a good idea to bluff. Don't claim to have offers when you don't, or say you would stay independent when you have to wind down. Acquirers are sophisticated. They will conduct more due diligence. They will talk to competitors. A company rarely buys another one just because they think there is competition.</p>
<p>When deals don't work out, and often they don't, you want to live to fight another day. You may sell to the same buyer in the future when the right circumstances arise. Follow through this process truthfully. Not all companies find a home, and that's okay. But your reputation and integrity matter much more in the long run.</p>
