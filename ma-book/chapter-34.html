  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>If running a startup is a rollercoaster, the M&amp;A middle game is that rollercoaster on steroids. Some days you feel like you're crushing it. The buyer agrees with everything in due diligence. They sing praises about what a perfect match this is. Then the next week, no replies. No returned calls. All hope feels lost.</p>
<p>I've been there. When we were talking to an Australian company, every meeting felt great. Our team killed the due diligence meetings. Their leaders and technical experts were impressed by our customer focus, technical depth, and ability to execute. But for some reason, replies always came weeks apart.</p>
<p>It got bad. I couldn't sleep for more than ten minutes at night. I kept checking my phone for emails because of the time zone difference. Food had no taste. When I spent time with family, I wasn't present. My mind was elsewhere, overthinking what the holdup was. Some days I wanted to fly to their headquarters and confront our point person. When he finally replied with a superficial excuse about working hard on the deal, or needing one more sign-off before sending the term sheet, I'd be happy for a couple days. But that term sheet never came.</p>
<p>Looking back, I don't know how I made it through. But a few things helped me get through those dark moments.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Figure out a routine</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Working out in the mornings and reading at night got me through the middle game. Before the term sheet, progress depends entirely on the buyer. Some days I felt like I accomplished nothing because the buyer hadn't replied after a promised update. So I set a goal: complete a 10K run or 100 pool laps in the morning, and read a chapter of a book in the evening. It sounds small. But these tiny milestones gave me a sense of accomplishment when nothing else was moving.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Still allocate time each day to work on company products and technology</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>We started companies because we wanted to work on interesting problems and build products people love. Being in an M&amp;A doesn't mean you stop doing that. You have to keep building. The M&amp;A game is all-consuming, and it's easy to burn out when you have no control over the pace.</p>
<p>I made this mistake. I expected the deal to close in a quarter. After six months of M&amp;A decks and due diligence prep with nothing to show for it, my identity took a massive hit. I had to face reality: the company needed to survive on its own through the winter of deal making. I should have spent part of every day building products and technology. When I finally started doing that again, it helped me reorient. Some of the joy came back.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Lean on your cofounders</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Often, the only person who truly understands what you're going through is your cofounder. You can't talk to employees about any of this. Your family would be saints if they could tolerate M&amp;A updates for more than a week. Lean on your cofounders. Talk regularly about the stress and brainstorm ways to push through.</p>
<p>During our M&amp;A, Borui and I talked every day. Sometimes for hours, sometimes just a few minutes. At minimum, we checked in on each other and analyzed the latest situation. We are emotional beings. Having a partner who supports you during this time is invaluable. There were many times I was about to send an email to a straggling buyer that I would have regretted, and Borui talked me down. There were also times when Borui was losing his mind, second-guessing whether our buyer was even interested, and I talked him down.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Find your support group</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Every M&amp;A is different. Lessons from other founders' exits rarely applied to my case. And these conversations are confidential. I didn't tell even my closest friends we were going through a process.</p>
<p>This is where having bankers and advisors helped. The main value they added wasn't finding buyers or negotiating deals. It was the therapy sessions. If it weren't for our bankers, I would have taken the worst deal on the table early in the process. Find a support group or advisor who's been through this before.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Know that failure is an option</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This is the hardest thing to accept as a founder: years of hard work and sacrifice may not result in any financial return. Take solace in the fact that you learned a lot and will come out stronger.</p>
<p>When I ran calculations on what my payout should be to match big tech compensation, I became bitter and self-destructive. So I stopped. The worst outcome is not finding a buyer or winding down. It's not as scary as it sounds. There are plenty of opportunities for the next company or a role at another tech company. There is no shame in swinging for the fences and striking out. At least I took my shot and did everything I could.</p>
