  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Due diligence across different areas will likely happen at the same time. You and your cofounders should handle these yourselves instead of involving employees. If you must bring someone in, keep the circle as small as possible. At this stage, the odds of closing with this buyer are low. Getting employees involved too early sets a false expectation that a deal is imminent. When the deal stalls or falls apart later, it devastates morale.</p>
<p>Answer every question truthfully. If you don't know something, take it as an action item and come back with the right answer after doing your homework. The acquirer will respect that. What matters is not how much you know, but how seriously you treat each question. This is about building trust. If there is no trust, there is no deal. And if something changes at your company that could affect the deal terms, share it proactively. Don't let the acquirer find out on their own.</p>
<p>Let's walk through each area of due diligence. Your key point of contact, the internal champion driving this deal, will likely attend all of these meetings. Depending on her area of responsibility, she may bring in other leaders to help drive conversations she doesn't manage.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. People</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Attendees from Acquirer: Head of HR, People Managers</p>
<p>Materials Under Review: Cultural Docs, Cap Table, Roster, Org Chart, Past Performance Reviews, Leveling Guideline, Compensation History, Employment Contracts</p>
<p>Of all the due diligence areas, this one is the most straightforward. If the process has gotten this far, there is already some rapport and cultural fit between the two companies. Still, this is the acquirer's chance to spot red flags or personnel issues. When asked about your culture or values, back them up with anecdotes.</p>
<p>The acquirer's HR team will walk through your roster and ask about each employee. What does this person work on day-to-day? What is her domain expertise? How critical is she to the acquisition? Would she want to be part of it?</p>
<p>At the end, the acquiring company will decide whether the team is a fit, what the reporting structure would look like, and which employees to retain, which to give transitional contracts, and which to let go. You always hope everyone gets retained. That's the ideal case. But in any M&amp;A, some positions will be redundant after the deal closes. Internal HR, marketers, and support staff are the most likely to be cut. Top engineers, product leaders, and design talent who are hard to hire on the open market will be highly valued.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Financial</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Attendees from Acquirer: CFO, Analysts, Third-Party Accountant/Auditor (Optional)</p>
<p>Materials Under Review: Past 3-5 years of Balance Sheet, P&amp;L, Cash Flow, Bank Statements, Credit Card Statements, Tax Returns, Future Financial Projections/Forecasts, Large Customer Contracts, Large Vendor Contracts, Debt Obligations</p>
<p>This is the least fun due diligence of them all. People compare the financial DD to a cavity search. The acquirer may bring on a third-party auditor to comb through all your books and question every expense from the last three to five years. This is where having clean budgets and balanced books makes a world of difference. If you have a CFO or bookkeeper, this is the one case where it makes sense to include a non-founder in the process. When they ask something you don't remember or don't know, take an action item and follow up after the meeting. Never lie. Never mislead. A deal cannot happen without trust.</p>
<p>The acquirer will ask for your financial forecast for the coming quarters or year. You may be tempted to give optimistic numbers hoping for a better deal. Don't. Closing can take quarters, sometimes a year. If you miss your own forecasts during that time, it casts a bad light on the deal and could kill it. Give conservative estimates. Then over-deliver.</p>
<p>Based on this information, the acquirer will model out future revenue and expenses. They'll use that as one of the key inputs for the deal price and retention packages. But M&amp;A is more emotional than rational. The projections only serve as a reference.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Governance / Legal</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Attendees from Acquirer: General Counsel</p>
<p>Materials Under Review: Company Bylaws, Litigations, Cap Table, Court Orders, Incorporation Documents, Board Meeting Minutes, Fundraising Docs, Other Legal Contracts</p>
<p>The goal here is to make sure your company is properly incorporated, well governed, and free of outstanding lawsuits that could derail the deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Product</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Attendees from Acquirer: Product Executives, Design Executives</p>
<p>Materials Under Review: Access to Products, Metrics, Descriptive Materials, Roadmaps, User Interviews</p>
<p>Expect whiteboard sessions on product strategy, user personas, go-to-market, positioning, and integrations. Keep an open mind about what the rebranded version of your product might look like. The acquirer may scrap your brand and logo entirely, erasing every trace of your company from the internet.</p>
<p>The DD may also involve digging into your metrics and understanding how trends shaped your product decisions. You may get tough feedback on your products and be asked to justify UI/UX choices or feature priorities. Don't get defensive. Share your rationale and treat it as a discussion. Get a feel for what working together might look like. The acquirer is doing the same thing. They're testing what it's like to work with you.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Technology</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Attendees from Acquirer: Engineering / Research Executives, Tech Leads</p>
<p>Materials Under Review: Access to Codebases, Engineering Dashboards, Technology Stacks, Descriptive Materials</p>
<p>Your CTO or VP of Engineering may be asked to present key technology stacks, engineering processes, and the upcoming roadmap. They may also walk through code with the acquirer's counterparts. The acquirer wants to review your code and commit logs. They're looking at codebase complexity, build and deployment processes, code quality, who the key contributors are, and how productive they are. These conversations will be technical and may take several meetings depending on the scope. As you prepare, think about how to explain the "why" behind each engineering process, architecture decision, or tradeoff.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Miscellaneous</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Depending on your business, there may be other areas the acquirer wants to examine. For example, if your company operates in China and generates significant revenue there, that will likely get its own diligence track. It's unique to your business and may be a big reason they want to buy you.</p>
