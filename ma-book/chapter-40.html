  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>A startup should not be a trap. It is not a life sentence. Sometimes the only option when no buyers are found and cash is running low is to shut down the company. There is no shame in that. Most startups die. But do it on your own terms.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Don't let the bank shut you down because you couldn't make payroll. Don't let the board fire you because you couldn't see the writing on the wall. Don't let your customers find out you're gone because your app or APIs suddenly stopped working without warning.</p>
<p>Instead, discuss it with your board and reach a consensus. Check with your lawyer on proper procedures. Have them draft a wind-down plan with clear action items. Inform your employees, vendors, and customers about what it means for them.</p>
<p>This way, you still get to write your own eulogy and life still can go on after that.</p>
