<p>In the term sheet, it will include the key terms previously negotiated which include the type of the deal, considerations and retention. A couple other things to call out in this document is that there is a binding section of exclusivity as well as information embargo placed upon you, while terms for the acquiring company are completely non-binding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the term sheet outlines expectations on the closing date, typically the same as the exclusive period. It also includes a set of closing conditions which are things that still need to be completed. It finally includes the transaction documents and provides expectations on what type of documents are needed to close the deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Things to Negotiate in a Term Sheet</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Even though the key terms are agreed upon already, the term sheet now needs to be forwarded to your lawyers for review and redline any items that could be potentially problematic. For one, if your acquirer is not based in the US, the governing law for which the M&amp;A adheres to would need to be aligned on. This may require you hiring lawyers in the geographic region where the acquiring company does business.</p>
<p>Even though the term sheet is non-binding for the acquirer, there are binding terms for you as the seller. Most notably, there is a no-shop clause baked into the agreement. Expect this clause to be there unless the offer is not serious, it protects the buyer from doing all the diligence work only to find out that you will bolt midway through the process or take a better offer elsewhere. While you cannot negotiate the exclusivity, you could negotiate the exclusivity period down to say 30 to 45 days instead of the stand 60 depending on how much leverage you have. Having a shorter exclusivity period could actually hasten the final closing period which keeps everyone focused on the deal and the risk of deal fatigue if the closing drags out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there will likely be a set of closing conditions, where you should consult with your lawyer on the feasibility of meeting these conditions. Most of the time they are rather standard, but watch out for those terms that are beyond reasonable that are outside of your control. For instance, a buyer could impose a 100% retention of your customers before closing, which you should push back as such a request is unreasonable and having minor customer churn does not bring material difference to your business.</p>
<p>There is a sweet spot in terms of how much you should negotiate the term sheet with your potential acquirer. If the terms are clean and reasonable, then there are no issues with executing and moving on to the next phase of due diligence. However, if the terms are unreasonable and ambiguous, definitely push back as the negotiations done during the term sheet phase set the appropriate expectations for the final negotiations on the definitive agreement. If you come off as pushovers at this stage and accept key terms without contest, expect the definitive agreement negotiations to be lopsided where you or the company directors fronting all the risks and indemnifying for all liabilities. The goal is to arrive at somewhere that's reasonable for both sides, and also set appropriate negotiation expectations as you move forward to the next step of diligence and finalizing the transaction documents.</p>
<p>At this point, negotiations on the term sheet should be handed off to your lawyers given that you have an experienced M&amp;A counsel. They will be much better and more efficient at spotting potential landmines in the legalese with respect to reps and warranties, indemnification caps, and other critical terms. They will also be able to play the bad cops in negotiations while you maintain a good relationship with the buyers as ultimately you still have to work for the buyers once the deal closes. Finally, in the unlikely event that you do get litigated down the road by an existing shareholder, the plaintiff will almost always attack the process and conflict management. Having outside counsel steer the redlines builds a discoverable record that the board acted with due care independence, demonstrated reliance on expert advice, and unlikely negotiated in bad faith.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. You Are Still Miles Away from the FInish Line</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Now you are finally ready to sign on the dotted line, but little do you know that this momentous day in months if not years in the endless M&amp;A preparations, meetings, and negotiations is only the clearing of the opening hurdle. You and the potential buyer have simply moved from courtship to actual audit phase, with the buyer having the right to walk away at any time.</p>
<p>Now it is not unusual to close a deal in the targeted time frame if the deal is small, your board is aligned, and the transaction is not subject to regulatory or third-party approvals. Nevertheless, there is still a mountain load of work that needs to be done in order to close the deal. See table below for some of the big ticket items and why they can potentially drag on.</p>
