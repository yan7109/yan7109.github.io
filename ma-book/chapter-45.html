    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 45</span>280G Analysis</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>One of the less glamorous but important aspects of selling your startup is dealing with a 280G analysis. Section 280G of the IRS tax code addresses payments made to executives (including founders) in connection with a change of control, such as an acquisition. These payments, often including severance packages, retention bonuses, or accelerated vesting of equity, are scrutinized to ensure they are not considered excessive. They are also known as "golden parachutes". This process should start as soon as the compensation packages are agreed upon.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Why Does 280G Matter?</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Failing to properly address 280G can lead to significant tax consequences. That includes a punitive 20% excise tax imposed on the recipients and loss of tax deductions for the acquiring company. Both parties have a strong incentive to ensure compliance.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Key Components of 280G Analysis</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>1. Calculating the Threshold: The threshold for determining excessive payments is three times the individual's average annual compensation over the past five years. Any payments exceeding this amount are at risk of triggering the excise tax.</p>
<p>2. Considerations and Retentions: The specific terms and components of the compensation packages negotiated during the deal are critical. Retention bonuses, severance payments, and equity acceleration all count. Every detail matters. Minor adjustments can significantly impact the outcome of the 280G analysis.</p>
<p>3. Shareholder Vote Requirement: Payments that exceed the threshold can avoid the harsh penalties if approved by shareholders. But there's a catch. Only shareholders who are not recipients of the compensation being voted on can participate in the vote. Founders and other key executives typically cannot vote to approve their own compensation packages.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Ensuring a Smooth Approval Process</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The approval requires an affirmative vote from at least 75% of disinterested shareholders. This is why maintaining open, transparent relationships with your key stakeholders matters, particularly your lead investors. The good news is that votes typically align with the recommendations of the lead investors. Rejections of these compensation packages are rare, provided relationships are strong and communication is clear.</p>
<p>Delays in this approval process can hold up the deal's closing timeline. To avoid this, initiate the 280G analysis and shareholder approval process as soon as the compensation package terms are finalized. Being proactive here demonstrates diligence to both investors and acquirers. It reassures them that you're well-prepared and organized.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Main Takeaways for Founders</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>1. Understand Early: Familiarize yourself early with what triggers 280G issues.</p>
<p>2. Communicate Clearly: Be transparent with your investors about why certain compensation elements are necessary for the business continuity post-acquisition.</p>
<p>3. Be Proactive: Initiate the shareholder approval process promptly after finalizing compensation details to avoid delays.</p>
<p>4. Maintain Relationships: Cultivate trust with key stakeholders and lead investors to ensure smooth passage of necessary approvals.</p>
<p>A 280G analysis might seem daunting at first. But careful planning and clear communication make this a straightforward process. Approached thoughtfully, 280G becomes just another checklist item on your path to closing.</p>
