  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Recently I received a LinkedIn message from a college classmate (let's call him Colton, not his real name) whom I haven't talked to in over a decade. I knew he had started his own company shortly after graduation in the hardware space and experienced lots of early traction through partnerships and press coverage. A few minutes into the conversation, he told me that his startup, once the darling of news outlets, had raised over $1 million in venture funding and now had around $300K in debt. The worst part was that all of the debt was on his own collateral. It was about to default in two weeks. He had laid off all of his full-time employees and only had two contractors left. He needed help finding a buyer, ideally completing everything within two weeks so he didn't have to declare bankruptcy. He wanted to know if I would be interested in acquiring his startup. And if his description didn't convey how dire things were, the Zoom link he sent started an automatic countdown to end the meeting. He was on the free plan. It had a forty minute limit. The very last words I squeezed in before Zoom kicked us out: I would send him an email with some practical advice.</p>
<p>It was one of the most difficult emails to write, but the content of the message was simple.</p>
<div class="email-block">
<p class="short-line">Hey Colton,</p>
<p>I thought about your situation a bit more over the last few days and unfortunately don't have any good solutions. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>The best case in this scenario is to consult with a good bankruptcy lawyer to minimize the exposure to you personally while winding down the business. Unfortunately this is not an area that I'm familiar with, but I would talk to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="short-line">Lmk if you want to chat again,</p>
<p class="short-line">Derek</p>
</div>
<p>The cavalry was not coming. Colton needed to get his affairs in order and limit the damage. I didn't even mention M&amp;A as a possible option. Even if he had an acquisition offer in hand, two weeks was far too short to complete a deal. Finding a buyer for a business, even in a firesale, takes months if not years of preparation.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs turn to an exit as a last-ditch hail mary to save the business from bankruptcy or as a way to leave the company for good. But almost all of them fail. The company runs out of cash before finding a buyer, or the founder quits along the way. This happens even to startups that raise hundreds of millions of dollars, or have sizable revenues and great products.</p>
<p>When founders ask me about the minimum runway for an exit, I tell them they need cash to stay afloat for at least one year. Ideally eighteen months. If they don't have this runway, the most important thing is to cut expenses, increase revenue, or find outside investment. M&amp;A is all about relationships. Unless there is already a strong business connection with the acquiring company and a personal relationship with its executives, building that takes a long time. The analogy I like to use is getting married, except with a twist. The person you want to marry has to propose to you first. Then they need to convince their parents and extended family that marrying you is the best idea since sliced bread. And by the way, your prospective in-laws are not that gullible or friendly.</p>
<p>You could try to woo a large public company into making an acquisition offer. But that's almost impossible without a competing offer in hand. Just getting a meeting with all the key stakeholders could take weeks. The decisions require committee consensus, so due diligence requests from product, engineering, marketing, finance, and legal departments drag on for months. And because everything including the balance sheet needs to be disclosed, they would quickly find out the business is running out of cash. At that point they could just hire your employees without paying you a dime. The incentives aren't there for the buyer when you are selling a business that is going out of business. In the past, if your company had specialized talent, there were always acquihire offers from big tech companies. But with the rise of AI agents, the premium paid for that talent has dropped sharply. There are very few non-top-AI-talent acquihire deals in the market today.</p>
<p>Almost all completed acquisitions come from inbound interest. And nearly every acquiring company had a prior relationship with the business it bought, whether through partnerships, investments, or being a customer. There is often no way to engineer inbound interest without an existing offer. All you can do is make sure you have enough cash in the bank to fight another day and build relationships early with anyone who could be a potential buyer down the line.</p>
