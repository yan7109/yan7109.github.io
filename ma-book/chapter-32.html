    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 32</span>Key Employee Interviews</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>As part of technical due diligence, the acquirer may ask to interview a few key employees. In extreme cases, they'll want to interview your entire roster. This is common in acquihire scenarios. The acquiring company doesn't care about your products or technology. They only care whether the team passes the technical interviews, which tells them if the team can deliver on planned work after the acquisition.</p>
<p>The more strategic the acquisition, the less rigorous the technical interviews. For a straight-up strategic buy, the interviews shift almost entirely to cultural fit with no technical vetting. The acquirer wants to keep the product and strategy intact. They don't want to rock the boat by disrupting the team's focus on execution.</p>
<p>Most of the time, interviews happen after the term sheet is signed, or at least after terms are agreed in principle. If the acquirer pushes for interviews early, use that as leverage to push for a term sheet. Having the team interview with the acquirer tells the whole company that an M&amp;A is happening. That's risky for morale. Limit the exposure to a handful of key employees, and save the full company interviews for after the term sheet is signed.</p>
<p>So let's break down the two aspects of the interview into technical and cultural below:</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Technical</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The acquiring company will try to map your PEDs (product managers, engineers, and designers) to their internal leveling system. For an acquihire, expect full interviews like you'd get applying to Google or Meta. For a strategic deal, it's a lighter version where they confirm everyone is leveled correctly and spot any red flags.</p>
<p>Technical interviews are nothing like day-to-day work. Take them seriously and get your key employees to prepare well in advance. Do mock interviews where they whiteboard, code, or design from scratch. People do fail these interviews, and at this stage the consequences are severe. If enough of your key engineers can't code in real time during acquihire interviews, there will be no deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Cultural</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>For cultural interviews, the acquirer wants to know if your employees are a good cultural fit and if they're motivated to join. Some employees only want to work at a small company. They have no desire to join a big corporation. Your job is to prepare them so there are no surprises during the actual interview.</p>
