  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>A few years ago, when my wife and I were shopping for a starter house, we toured open houses on the weekends. We lived in Silicon Valley, so there was never a shortage of buyers. One thing we noticed early on: every house we toured, even ones built in the middle of the last century, had a fresh coat of paint and new floors. Most were staged with nice furniture and snacks. These houses always sold over asking with multiple competing offers. Yet sellers and agents still made the effort to stage them so buyers felt the house was move-in ready.</p>
<p>The same applies to M&amp;A. Every buyer's ideal is a zero-risk, turnkey, cash-generating business that needs little integration. The only thing that should need changing is the logo on the product or service. For a startup looking to be acquired, meeting this bar is tough. Sometimes impossible. You often don't know who the buyer will be. Still, here are areas you can work on to make your company more attractive.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Actionable Inbound Acquisition Offer/Interest</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The strongest signal you can send to the M&amp;A market is having an actionable inbound acquisition offer from another company. As explained in earlier chapters, this means a concrete offer with terms and considerations spelled out, from a company you're willing to work for. Inbound emails from big company corporate development teams don't count. A great offer from a company you're not willing to relocate for is not actionable either.</p>
<p>One nuance: the offer needs to be inbound, meaning you didn't ask for it. This matters because as the seller, you have all the leverage with inbound interest. The buyer will have more patience and goodwill as you shop around for the best deal.</p>
<p>Once you have this unsolicited offer in hand, the buyer typically imposes a tight deadline and an exclusive period after you sign. This makes it nearly impossible to get another buyer to spin up a competing offer. So move fast. Reach out to partners and potential acquirers who already know your business. Talk directly to decision makers and let them know you received a good offer. Don't disclose the terms, but let them know timing is tight and you'll likely accept.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to bring on an experienced banker who can help you negotiate and discover your true market value. Don't take the first offer. Talk to the board. Do your research. We'll cover tactics and negotiations in the next section.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Actionable Inbound Investment Interest/Offer</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The next best thing is an inbound investment offer. Buyers know that once a new investor comes on board, acquiring the company gets more expensive and more complicated. More stakeholders means more friction. So if you're considering an exit, test the capital markets first to build leverage before going into the M&amp;A market. Like the prior section, this investment offer needs to be inbound and actionable. Start with existing partners and prior relationships to explore possible exit plans.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Product/Service/Technology Differentiation and Specialization</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>There is no formula for success when presenting to a potential buyer. But one thing they always look for is market differentiation. Is there something truly special about what you offer? Is there a close second, or are you one of many? At Polarr, we worked on many products and services over the years. But one thing stayed constant: our specialization in using low level web technologies to build sophisticated photo editing tools for professionals. This narrowed our list of potential buyers. But it gave us something buyers saw as unique to Polarr.</p>
<p>As you figure out what makes you different, come up with metrics that measure its impact. If you're truly the best at what you do, the metrics and customer impact and growth rate should speak for themselves.</p>
<p>This may mean shelving products or services that don't have traction or aren't central to your core business. But be careful: what a buyer sees as your differentiation may not be what you think it is. Do as much homework as possible before reaching out. Come up with ideas for what working together would look like and what your company brings to the table.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Personnel</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Your team plays a major role in an acquisition. Buyers look for domain expertise, culture fit, efficiency, and willingness to work for them. As the entrepreneur, identify and remove personnel that don't fit these criteria. Supporting functions like HR and marketing often don't add value in an acquisition unless you're an HR or marketing company. For team members who are disgruntled, flight risks, or poor culture fits, let them go before engaging with buyers. These issues only get more complicated later.</p>
<p>One thing that can be problematic is having a fully remote team instead of one in a physical office. I personally think the reason Polarr was turned down by so many Silicon Valley tech giants was because we had a distributed team post-pandemic. Not enough of the core team were in the Bay Area. During the pandemic, a good chunk of our local employees moved to remote locations. We made the mistake of not asking everyone to return when the pandemic ended. As other companies returned to office, the remote nature of our business became a problem during due diligence. Having a remote team cuts down the number of companies willing to buy you.</p>
<p>Finally, there may be advisors still receiving stock grants who add little value, or past cofounders who own large stakes. Clean up the cap table as much as possible and reduce unnecessary advisorships. All of this comes up during personnel due diligence. Most won't be deal-breakers for the buyer, but the process runs a lot smoother when the cap table is tidy and the acquirer can see exactly who does what.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Reduce Your Burn Rate</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This is probably one of the most important areas to work on. Reduce your burn rate by cutting pet projects, unnecessary marketing spend, and redundant roles. M&amp;As take time. Sometimes the first few attempts don't work out. You need enough cash to live and fight another day. If you're burning cash and fundraising isn't promising, you'll be at the mercy of potential acquirers. They will dictate the terms. You need the option to walk away from an offer. The best leverage for that is a cash flow positive company, or at least one that's breaking even.</p>
<p>This doesn't apply to deep tech companies or businesses that need to raise a lot of cash before they can become profitable. But even then, be frugal. Reduce cash burn. Look for bridge loans and alternative financing like debt to extend your runway so you can find the right acquisition offer.</p>
<p>These are just a handful of areas you can improve before hitting the market. Nobody knows your company better than you. If something keeps you up at night that isn't mentioned here, address it before approaching acquirers. Now let's look at how to come up with a list of potential acquirers.</p>
