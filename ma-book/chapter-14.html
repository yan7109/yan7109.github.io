  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>In 2018, when my cofounder Borui and I were raising our Series A, we reached out to thirty-eight venture capitalists. We met twenty-eight for a first meeting. Around a dozen had a second meeting. We got one offer, from Draper Fisher and Jurvetson (DFJ, now Threshold VC). The whole process took a couple months.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is a completely different beast. In fundraising, most of the hundreds of VC firms on Sand Hill Road will hear your pitch. The list of companies willing to acquire your business is much shorter. If you're lucky, twenty potential targets will talk to you. The fundamental difference is that buyers are looking for a specific combination of strategy, product, technology, and team that solves an immediate pain point. Their need is so pressing that they've already exhausted easier options like building in-house or partnerships.</p>
<p>This is why outbound inquiries rarely result in anything. The acquiring company is too busy executing. Even if your company helps them get to their goal faster, you're not differentiated enough or don't have enough credibility for them to take notice.</p>
<p>So how do you come up with an outreach list? Start with companies you already have a strong relationship with. Customers, partners, or suppliers. Focus on those familiar with your offering and team. Write down the person you have a personal relationship with who could vouch for you internally.</p>
<p>If you don't have inbound interest, companies that already know you are your next best shot. You can almost count on getting a meeting from your contact. They have a business relationship with you. Your being acquired will affect their day-to-day.</p>
<p>One caveat: if the potential acquirer is a large customer with sizable accounts, be careful. Signaling M&amp;A interest could trigger them to look for other suppliers to reduce their risk. The test is how critical you are to their business. If your company vanished tomorrow, would their business suffer? If yes, you have leverage. They should be in the game, and chances are they'll pay top dollar. If not, leave them off the list. The risk of losing their account outweighs the chance of getting acquisition interest.</p>
<p>Next, list people who have a strong personal relationship with you and hold executive positions at large companies with overlapping interests. These should be people who have worked with you before and think highly of you. They may not be the right person to lead a deal, but they can route your material to the right department and put in a good word. Weak introductions through weak connections are worse than no introductions at all. Use your existing network to make introductions rather than reaching out cold.</p>
<p>Last, put together a list of companies in your space that could benefit from acquiring your product, team, or technology. Be liberal here, especially if you're in a competitive space like AI or SaaS. Research which companies are making moves in the news. Big tech companies like Google, Apple, or Meta almost always have a team working on a similar or adjacent space. If they're not on the list, add them. You can rely on your network or investors to find a contact at these companies.</p>
<p>Should you put your competitors on the list? Unless you're willing to sell for cheap, I would leave them off. Reaching out to a competitor asking to be acquired will never get you a respectable offer. They will almost always use the opportunity to extract as much proprietary information as they can. Unless you're determined to sell for scraps, don't approach your competitors.</p>
<p class="short-line">Now let’s work on your outreach deck.</p>
