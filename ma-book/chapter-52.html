<p>When the deal finally closes, regardless of how substantial or modest your financial outcome is, take the time to acknowledge and show appreciation to those who supported you. Success never happens in isolation. Behind every entrepreneur is a network of people whose guidance, patience, and support were instrumental.</p>
<p>Your board members and investors deserve special acknowledgment. Their trust, patience, and backing played a significant role in bringing the deal to a close. A fitting gesture would be hosting a memorable dinner to express your gratitude. This meal might be the priciest dinner tab you'll ever cover. But it's also a rare opportunity to express genuine thanks to those who believed in your vision from the beginning. Make it meaningful. This gesture of gratitude solidifies lasting positive relationships.</p>
<p>Your significant other has likely borne the emotional toll of your entrepreneurial journey. They've endured your stress, anxiety, and frequent distractions over the months or even years leading up to this moment. Spend quality time together. Have an open conversation about how to best celebrate this milestone in your shared life.

It needn't be extravagant. A heartfelt home-cooked meal, a simple movie night out, or a special activity you've repeatedly postponed. My wife and I considered going back to Northern Italy as that was one of our favorite trips, but decided to wait until our kids were older. The significance isn't in the grandness of the gesture but in the sincerity of the acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Your children also shared indirectly in your entrepreneurial journey. They experienced your divided attention and late nights at work. Simple but meaningful gifts or gestures can communicate your appreciation. I chose to splurge on books for my kids, especially indulging my son's enthusiasm for the Smithsonian series. Little thoughtful gifts, tailored to their interests, can carry immense sentimental value.</p>
<p>Think about those individuals who were consistently your emotional anchors. Friends, mentors, colleagues, or family members who provided unwavering support during turbulent times. A personalized handwritten card expressing your gratitude can be incredibly meaningful and long-lasting.</p>
<p>For your broader team, even those who were not retained, consider hosting a celebratory event or team outing. It could be a weekend retreat, a team dinner, or a simple catered lunch at the office. Publicly recognizing each team member's contribution during these gatherings strengthens team bonds and morale.

Another meaningful approach is providing personalized gifts or small bonuses tailored to their individual interests or needs. It reinforces the idea that their contributions have not gone unnoticed.

Our Head of Peoples was not offered a position from the acquiring company, but he did an immense amount of work leading to the acquisition. So my cofounder Borui spent money out-of-pocket to accompany him on an all-expense-paid international trip, thanking him for the work he put in. Borui also went out of his way to send referrals to other entrepreneurs who might be hiring for his type of role.</p>
<p>Express your gratitude to your key contact or sponsor from the acquiring company. Their advocacy and support throughout the acquisition process were a big part of why the deal got done. Craft a thoughtful handwritten note or give a modest but meaningful gift. These gestures of appreciation help set the tone for the ongoing working relationship.</p>
<p>Closing an acquisition is not just an ending. It's a chance to express real gratitude. By acknowledging those who helped you get here, you strengthen relationships that will matter long after the deal is done.</p>
