  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>People often asked me what my biggest purchases were after my acquisition. Truthfully, I bought a second-hand upright Yamaha piano for my kids for $3,300 and a second-hand camera lens for $700. Even now, I still view a Chipotle lunch as a splurge and limit myself to eating there just once a week. My co-founder Borui's story is even more amusing. He doesn't cook and regularly eats at the Whole Foods hot bar for lunch. He shared that his most noticeable post-acquisition change was no longer paying attention to the scale when filling his container. Previously, he'd consciously keep the weight under one pound, equating to around $12. Now, he simply doesn't give it a second thought.</p>
<p>As euphoric as the magical moment feels when that substantial cash balance finally lands in your bank account—likely the most significant amount you've ever seen—this initial surge of happiness will undoubtedly fade after a day or two. Very quickly, what once seemed life-changing becomes merely your new baseline, another number among many.</p>
<p>More important than any monetary considerations post-acquisition is refocusing on what truly brings you joy. The entire M&amp;A process likely drained much of the joy out of your daily life, replacing it with stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. If the outcome has been life-changing enough that you'll never need to work again—congratulations! However, understand this: entrepreneurs are inherently wired to build, create, and solve problems. The idea of endless travel or sitting on a beach indefinitely may initially sound appealing, but boredom inevitably sets in after just a few weeks.</p>
<p>So take time to seriously consider what genuinely brings you happiness, and focus on those pursuits. Some founders don't have the luxury of stepping away from work entirely, especially if the acquisition involves a retention package tied closely to future integration and performance milestones. In this case, dedicate your efforts to ensuring a smooth integration, enhancing the success of your products and services.</p>
<p>Yet, remember this: a significant weight has been lifted. You're free from the constant worry of making payroll, preparing for board meetings, or managing budgets and financial statements. Use this newfound mental space and time to engage with the things you've put off for far too long. Spend an afternoon on the beach alone, or finally watch that movie you've repeatedly postponed.</p>
<p>Personally, I always dreamed of documenting my journey through the M&amp;A process. But sitting down to write without knowing how the story would end was daunting. Would the company survive? Would my employees find new homes? Or would I soon need to polish my resume and start job hunting? Fortunately, the deal successfully closed, allowing me to share my experiences with other founders and aspiring entrepreneurs. I find immense joy in discussing these experiences, offering guidance, and providing support to others on similar paths. Rediscovering this sense of purpose and fulfillment has been one of the most rewarding outcomes of the entire journey.</p>
