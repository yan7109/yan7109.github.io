    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 49</span>Where the Deal Could Still Blow Up</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Even after the definitive agreement has been fully negotiated, approved by both the board and shareholders, and all 280G analyses and votes have concluded, there remains a real risk that the deal may not close. It may seem like all that remains is the wiring of funds and countersigning of documents. The reality is more complicated. Several factors, some within your control and others entirely beyond it, can jeopardize the closing.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Regulatory Approvals and Antitrust Risks</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>One significant risk is regulatory approvals. Certain deals trigger rigorous antitrust inquiries and regulatory reviews. This is especially true for deals involving large corporations, dominant market players, or specific industries such as telecommunications, technology, pharmaceuticals, and defense. These approvals can come from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the United States, the European Commission in Europe, or other regulatory bodies globally.</p>
<p>Transactions that significantly reduce competition, create monopolistic entities, or have major market share implications often attract intense scrutiny. In the U.S., the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act) mandates filing with the FTC and DOJ if the transaction exceeds certain monetary thresholds. These thresholds are adjusted annually and currently exceed approximately $126.4 million (as of 2025). If the acquiring or acquired parties meet certain size-of-party thresholds, the deal is subject to mandatory reporting and approval.

High-profile examples include Microsoft's acquisition attempts of Activision Blizzard and Adobe's proposed acquisition of Figma. Both were subject to extensive antitrust challenges. Regulatory approvals can take months or even years. Prolonged uncertainty can kill the deal. Check with your lawyers if these cases apply.</p>
<p>When selling to a foreign company, particularly from countries like China, additional regulatory hurdles come into play. In the U.S., this involves a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which evaluates potential national security risks. Other jurisdictions may require approvals related to foreign ownership or investment restrictions. These processes can be unpredictable and politically influenced. They can significantly extend deal timelines or even lead to outright denial.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Third-Party Consents and Transfer Risks</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Third-party consents, such as approvals from key business partners, licensors, lessors, banks, or major customers, represent another hurdle. Even minor resistance or delays from these stakeholders can halt or derail the entire transaction. The transfer of assets like intellectual property, real estate, or licenses can also encounter unexpected legal or bureaucratic obstacles. You can prepare by maintaining clear contractual language and proactively securing third-party buy-in. But some situations remain unpredictable.</p>
<p>A couple examples of this could be the notice and approval of the sale from a platform that you do your business on, say Apple or Google if you develop apps, or Roblox if you are a game developer on top of their platform. There could also be the issue where your key customers have languages in the contracts that require notices or approvals when there is a change of ownership or any type of liquidation event.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Financial and Performance-Related Risks</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Another substantial risk is the financial stability and business performance of both parties leading up to closing. The acquiring company may experience a particularly poor financial quarter. Their stock value may decline sharply, especially relevant if the deal includes stock-based consideration. Or they may uncover previously undisclosed material financial issues within the target company. Any of these can lead the buyer to reconsider and withdraw.</p>
<p>A badly missed revenue target by the seller, the emergence of significant liabilities or legal challenges, or revelations of unethical business practices, often uncovered in the final stages, can likewise derail the deal.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Human Factors and Emotional Considerations</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Sometimes the human element disrupts what might appear to be a solidified transaction. Misalignments, disagreements, or unexpected emotional decisions from either party's leadership can introduce doubt or erode trust enough to terminate negotiations. There have been instances where hastily signed term sheets, concluded without adequate reflection or diligence, unravel completely as the parties sit down to finalize the definitive agreement.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Importance of Diligence and Responsiveness</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>In this phase, responsiveness and careful timing become critical. Any unnecessary delay or lack of responsiveness can cast doubt. It can lead the buyer to question the seller's commitment or the accuracy of earlier disclosures. Promptly address all inquiries. Clearly communicate any arising issues. Remain consistently engaged until the transaction fully closes.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Early Alignment and Careful Term Sheet Negotiation</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Given the complexity and many potential pitfalls of the deal-closing process, substantial deliberation before signing the term sheet is important. Both parties should fully understand their commitments, responsibilities, and mutual expectations. Hastily executed agreements, driven by impulse or surface-level alignment, often lead to significant disruptions later. The definitive agreement stage is far too late to uncover fundamental misunderstandings.</p>
<p>In summary, although the definitive agreement marks substantial progress, the closing phase still carries real risks. Stay responsive and proactive, control what you can, and prepare contingencies for what you cannot.</p>
