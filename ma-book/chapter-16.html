    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 16</span>Should You Hire a Banker?</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Frankly, bankers are only helpful when you have a great company in a hot space with multiple buyers lined up. In that scenario, a seasoned banker can help you discover your true market value. They handle the negotiations without damaging your relationship with the acquirer. You know you're in this situation when a buyer reaches out through multiple channels with an unsolicited verbal offer. If you respond that you have a fiduciary duty and need to run a process and they're still interested, that's the perfect time to hire a banker.</p>
<p>Ask your board members for recommendations. In banking, it's all about referrals and past clients. Talk to a few bankers and see how well you work together.</p>
<p>The first question to answer: who will you actually be working with, and does this person have the network to create a bidding environment? The premium you pay for bankers is their network. That's what discovers the true market value of your company. If you only have one potential offer, that is the market price.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to work with a big firm whose named partners make headlines. Be warned. Unless you have a sought-after company with a high price tag, the person working with you might be a fresh MBA with no experience and no connections. You might not get the level of expertise you expected when the named principals sold you on their firm.</p>
<p>Ask whether they'll stick around when things get tough and the market turns. Ask about a company they couldn't sell. Try to understand how persistent and creative they are. Bankers love to boast their biggest deals. That's like a lottery winner telling you their numbers. It's not helpful. Every deal is different and the M&amp;A market changes on a whim. There's also survivorship bias. Some bankers only take on clients they know will make them money. So vet for cases where deals fell apart and ask what they learned. These happen more often than bankers like to admit. Some bankers give up after a few rounds of outreach once they realize a client's company isn't an easy sell. Sometimes the market just isn't there. But you want to see that they knocked on every door.</p>
<p>Finally, can they articulate your company's mission and understand the details of your business? Ask about the most difficult clients they've worked with, what made it hard, and check references.</p>
<p>Bankers are expensive. On a per-person basis, if you have a successful exit, they'll make the most money of anyone on the cap table relative to their investment. They typically charge a percentage of the final sale consideration plus the retention package. Even if you sell to a private company and get paid in private stock, they value it as cash and get paid in cash. The percentage ranges from three to five percent. Top bankers charge on the higher end. Boutique or up-and-coming bankers may charge a bit less. You can negotiate these rates, but don't expect to go below three percent.</p>
<p>Some bankers also charge a retainer fee, either one-time or monthly. This protects them from the risk of discovering there's no market for your company and covers their opportunity cost. One-time retainer fees range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The retainer can sometimes be credited toward the final payout when the deal closes. Monthly retainers usually apply when the market is weak and the banker needs to do heavy discovery work. In that case, they're doing outbound business development, building partnerships and relationships.</p>
<p>Bankers almost never take stock. They get paid first, just like lawyers, when a deal closes. Have your lawyers review the banker contract before you sign it. Look for clauses around termination and tail periods. Sometimes bankers don't pull their weight and you need to fire them. Make sure the contract addresses that so it doesn't lead to litigation.</p>
<p>Should you hire a banker when there's no actionable inbound interest and no prior relationships? I'd say no. In that case, bankers typically rely on their network of Corp Dev contacts and present your company to a long list of companies that have nothing to do with your space. Or that you have no interest working for. You might get lucky, but the probability of those conversations leading to an acquisition is close to zero. Your money is better spent building products or developing relationships yourself.</p>
<p>In any M&amp;A scenario, the acquiring company would rather talk to you as the founder than to a banker. They want to build rapport. They want to know if they can trust you and work with you based on firsthand interactions. Bringing in bankers too early sends the wrong signal and can hurt your chances. Remember: there's nothing your banker does that you can't do yourself. They can only help move a deal along when there's a deal to be had. They can't create one out of thin air. A deal you're willing to take needs to come from inbound interest.</p>
