    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 50</span>Closing It Out</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Closing day is the end result of months of negotiations, approvals, and planning. The definitive agreement, already approved by both boards and shareholders including the 280G analysis, is ready to be officially signed and executed. Despite its ceremonial appearance, closing day demands careful preparation and execution to make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Critical Signatures and Documentation</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Your lawyers will manage this process for you on closing day. Several key documents require signatures and countersignatures, including:</p>
<p>1. Final Definitive Agreement</p>
<p>2. Disclosure Schedules</p>
<p>3. Assignment and Assumption Agreements</p>
<p>4. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements</p>
<p>5. Employment Agreements for retained employees</p>
<p>6. Termination Agreements and Release Forms for departing employees</p>
<p>7. Bill of Sale and Transfer Documents</p>
<p>8. IP Assignment Agreements</p>
<p>9. Resignation Letters from departing board members and executives</p>
<p>10. Dissolution of the board of directors</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Financial Transactions and Payments</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>A big part of closing day is the financial settlement. By this time, the acquiring company should have already wired the agreed-upon purchase funds to the seller's designated bank account. Once received, the proceeds need to be immediately distributed according to pre-agreed amounts to:</p>
<p>1. Shareholders</p>
<p>2. Outstanding creditors and vendors</p>
<p>3. Investment bankers and legal advisors</p>
<p>You or your CFO should manage this process physically at a bank branch alongside your banker. This ensures accuracy, security, and timely execution. Having at least two individuals overseeing this step is essential to reduce the risk of errors or wire fraud, which can be more common with virtual transactions.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Asset Transfer</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Certain key assets integral to the completion of the deal must also be transferred on closing day. Common examples include:</p>
<p>1. Source code repositories (via GitHub or other platforms)</p>
<p>2. App store listings and ownership transfers</p>
<p>3. Domain names and intellectual property rights</p>
<p>Proper documentation confirming asset transfers must be verified to prevent future disputes or liabilities.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Employee Transition and Communications</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Closing day typically marks the last day of employment for all employees. Serve termination documents and finalize severance agreements for those not retained. A generous severance package, along with signed release forms, goes a long way toward maintaining goodwill and minimizing post-transaction disputes.</p>
<p>This is also the moment to announce the transaction formally to the broader team. Highlight the new joint direction with the acquiring team. Invite key executives from the acquiring company to give a talk. Acknowledge the work put into this process by the entire company and congratulate everyone for making it to the other side. It is a huge milestone regardless of the financial outcome.

Clarity and sensitivity during these announcements are essential to maintain morale and ensure a smooth transition. Retained employees will also sign their new employment letters and should get informed individually of their new compensation packages, including base salary, stock options, retention bonus, and other considerations.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Payroll and Final Settlements</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>A final payroll run should be conducted to settle prorated salaries up to the closing date, including payment for unused vacation days.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Public Announcement and Press Release</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>A pre-drafted press release distributed on closing day can effectively mark the milestone publicly. It recognizes the collective hard work and achievements. It also provides closure after the stress and intensity of negotiations and due diligence.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">7. Personal Anecdote: Our Acquisition</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Our deal with our acquirer closed on April 30th, 2025, a Wednesday. We had a 10am meeting with our entire team announcing the deal. Even though at this point everyone already knew as everybody was interviewed by the acquiring company, there were still some emotions running through everyone. We shared our fond memories of first starting out, the times when we thought the company was going to run out of money, and those who we missed.

My co-founder Borui and I met for lunch, anxiously checking our phones throughout the meal. Around 1 pm, the funds arrived in our account. Banks close at 5 pm EST, adding urgency to the moment. Seeing the money come through was an immense relief. It instantly lifted years of uncertainty and stress. I vividly recall the overwhelming realization: we did it, we actually did it. Borui headed to the office to manage a few logistical details, including signing a short-term lease. I headed home for a well-deserved nap.</p>
<p>Closing day is not just an administrative milestone. It's a deeply human moment marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.</p>
