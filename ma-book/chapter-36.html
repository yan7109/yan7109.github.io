  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>When there are no offers and you still want to sell, the most gut-wrenching option is reaching out to your most bitter competitor about a potential consolidation. This should be your last resort. Talking to a competitor means sharing your metrics and some trade secrets that benefit them directly. And they have no obligation to buy you, even after you hand them insights they'd normally pay top dollar for. But sometimes the only way to find a deal is to approach your rivals.</p>
<p>Swallow your pride. There is no shame in two competitors joining forces. It happens all the time. Some of the most successful companies came from competitors consolidating: PayPal and X, Pixar and Disney, United Airlines and Continental, Exxon and Mobil, Sirius and XM.</p>
<p>But since you're reaching out, expect the competitor to extract as much information as possible. If they like a segment or product enough to absorb it, expect the initial offer to be much worse than even an acquihire deal. If they're also privately held, you'll most likely get an all-stock offer.</p>
<p>Still, finding a home for your employees is worth something. If the competitor's prospects are better than yours, or the combined company has a brighter future, your stock might actually have a chance of becoming liquid someday. It's always more satisfying to beat your competitor than to join them. But sometimes combining makes sense. You consolidate duplicate functions, pool talent, and lift pricing power.</p>
<p>Before you call off the M&amp;A effort, ask yourself: have you talked to all your competitors? Would joining forces with a bitter rival create something worth more than either company alone?</p>
