    <h1>Foreword</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>It was the morning of May 15th, 2024. My mom's 60th birthday.</p>
<p>Instead of planning a birthday message, I was waiting for an email. After years of working toward this, I was expecting an acquisition term sheet from a $40 billion company.</p>
<p>They had wanted to buy us back in 2021. My cofounder Borui and I made the mistake of ghosting their founders after a good first meeting. The market soured. We had inbound interest and hired bankers to help negotiate deals, but the only offer we got was a full stock deal from a struggling startup that wanted our cash and income-producing assets. Nearly three years later, in January 2024, we reached back out as a last-ditch hail mary. They leaned in again. A term sheet felt imminent.</p>
<p>We had done days of product and technology due diligence. Their founders and execs spoke highly of us throughout. They gave us a valuation range and asked if it worked for us. It did, though it was on the lower end. They had everything they needed to make an offer.</p>
<p>Our last meeting had been perfect. We spent a good chunk of it talking about moving and good spots near their headquarters to settle our families. Our main contact on their side reassured us the offer was being finalized. We just needed to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>Then they went quiet. Every day without news made it worse. I was sleepless for days, checking my phone through the night. I had a dream where I flew 16 hours to their office but couldn't get in because all the doors were locked.</p>
<p>That morning, after a swim at the YMCA, my Apple Watch buzzed mid-dead hang on a horizontal bar. I let go to read the message, heart racing. It was not the yes or no I expected. It was a vague, long-winded email saying they needed more time and more people needed to weigh in.</p>
<p>I was crushed. Our team, our board, my family had mentally committed to this deal. The possibility of winding down our startup, which had raised over thirteen million dollars and partnered with big companies, felt real. I stood there, numb. What now?</p>
<p>If you are reading this, you have probably started a company and gotten it far enough to think about an exit. That puts you among the handful who sign the front of checks instead of the flock who sign the back.</p>
<p>But starting a business is trivial compared to finding a buyer. Starting a business is like launching a rocket into space. Selling it is like landing that rocket back on its pad. One wrong turn, and everything goes up in flames.</p>
<p>If this book has one message, it's that companies are bought, not sold. The only one who matters is the buyer. The buyer has to be convinced that partnering with you, licensing your product, or building it themselves won't cut it. That buying your entire business, with all its assets and liabilities, its people and their flaws, is the only option. The market for that is orders of magnitude smaller than the market for your products. Many entrepreneurs approach this like a fundraising pitch. It couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Borui and I tried to sell our company starting in 2021. I wished this book existed at the time. We thought we had enough going for us that it would be easy. It took almost four years to find the right buyer. Companies that set out to sell often end up dead. Selling a business takes a completely different set of skills than building one.</p>
<p>Hopefully the pain that I went through can serve as a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>Good luck. You will need it.</p>
