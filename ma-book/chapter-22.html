    <h1><span class="chapter-number">Chapter 22</span>The Inside View from an Inbound Reach Out</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>The only thing that matters in an inbound reachout is who sent it. That tells you how serious the acquisition interest is. Let's rank them in the order of the most actionable to the least.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. CEO/Founder</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>The buck stops at the CEO/Founder. No one at a company has more power. When she personally reaches out to you, directly or through a proxy like your board member or investor, many deliberations have already happened. She'll likely jump right into business at the first encounter. Her bandwidth is limited, and the acquisition is strategic to her current execution plan.</p>
<p>When you get an inbound like this, take it seriously. Prepare to give direct answers on whether you are open to an acquisition. But do not give a price tag right away. The right approach is to punt by saying you would like to consult with the board and run a process to let the market dictate the right price. If the interest is genuine, and in this case it most likely is, the inquiring CEO/Founder should have no issues with that. She could even preemptively provide a strong offer. It would be worthwhile to hire a banker to handle negotiations and gauge overall market interest.</p>
<p>One caveat. If what you are working on is so strategic that the CEO/Founder is directly involved in the acquisition, chances are she is also having similar conversations with your competitors. Don't overplay your hand. If the opportunity makes sense and your board signs off, engage with the founder and strike while the iron is hot.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Board Member/Investor</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Sometimes the CEO is too busy or inexperienced in doing deals. In such cases, she delegates to a Board Member or Investor who has more experience. This is the next best thing. The board member can serve as a noise filter and make a recommendation to the CEO after your initial meetings. She will likely stay involved throughout the process, helping with term negotiations and parts of the due diligence. Still expect the CEO to make the final decision on whether an acquisition will happen.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Product Executive</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>In large companies, product executives at the VP or Director level often have the autonomy to pursue acquisitions. These deals can be lucrative since they're usually strategic. But they may still require sign offs from senior executives in the C-suite.</p>
<p>Ask your point of contact whether she has done deals before and who makes the final decision. Work towards getting in front of that decision maker. If she is new to doing this, that's usually a bad sign. You'll most likely have to convince people further up the management chain to make sure a deal happens.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Engineering Executive</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Engineering executives mainly engage with startups when there is an acquihire opportunity. They need to fill roles they couldn't hire for externally. The deal sizes are typically smaller, and the interview process will be rigorous. They will ask you point blank whether you are willing to abandon your current product and work on theirs.</p>
<p>If you are open to that, the process will likely move quickly. The key decision maker will be the engineering executives. Confirm whether they have worked on such deals before, and make sure you are engaging with the final decision maker.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Bankers</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Sometimes acquiring companies hire bankers to scout potential acquisition targets. If the acquirer has your company specifically in mind, they would have approached you directly or used a proxy. Bankers come in when the acquirer is looking for a company that fits a set of constraints and wants someone to identify and engage with companies that match.</p>
<p>The good thing is, if your product, tech, or team fit the bill, things can move quickly. You will be connected with the acquiring company's executives. But understand that the bankers are talking to many companies. They are a proxy and do not have decision power. The acquisition thesis only becomes clear after the acquiring company's executive does her own due diligence on your company.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">6. Corporate Dev/Analysts</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This is likely the least productive engagement you will have. Still, take these conversations seriously and build relationships. What typically happens is that a product organization has a new initiative they are unfamiliar with and wants to gather information. They send their Corp Dev or Analysts to do market research and probe companies in the space on things like market size, customer discovery, and technology gaps.</p>
<p>Don't share anything sensitive to your business. Ask the purpose of these inquiries directly. Treat this as a learning opportunity. Understand what the inquiring company needs, and look for ways to be introduced to actual decision makers for future conversations.</p>
