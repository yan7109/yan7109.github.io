  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Bringing on bankers for an M&amp;A is optional. Hiring a competent law firm that specializes in M&amp;A is not. It's okay to cut costs on other things when selling your company. But spend the money on a good, reputable law firm with M&amp;A experience or a dedicated M&amp;A team. A bad law firm will give you bad advice on things like indemnifications and liabilities. Or they'll bill you so much that the transaction proceeds can't even cover the invoices.</p>
<p>Lawyers are paid by the billable hour, not by the outcome. Even if the deal falls apart and the company doesn't sell, they still get paid for the hours they worked. So when vetting a law firm, look for efficiency, prior deals, and who you'll actually work with. A good firm will assign you a veteran M&amp;A partner who is knowledgeable and efficient. They'll set an overall budget and guide you through the complexities of the transaction.</p>
<p>The lawyers' job is to formalize the transaction in legal documents and make sure all the procedures are followed to limit risk and liability. Depending on the type of transaction, the documents include stock or asset purchase agreements, disclosures, employment contracts, stockholder approvals, 280G analysis, and more.</p>
<p>M&amp;A law is complex and geography-specific. Delaware has different laws than California. It often involves multiple stakeholders with competing interests and tax implications. It's worth spending the money on a reputable firm, especially one that's worked with you before. During the disclosure phase, the acquiring company's counsel will ask for a wide array of documents. If your lawyers already have your files, they can respond quickly. Bringing on a new firm with no prior relationship means a lot of billable hours spent reading your data room, certificate of incorporation, fundraising docs, and so on.</p>
<p>If you already have a reputable law firm you like working with and they have a dedicated M&amp;A team, stick with them. Otherwise, ask around for boutique firms that specialize in M&amp;A. You typically work directly with the senior partners. Because they only do M&amp;As, they tend to be efficient, knowledgeable, and more affordable.</p>
<p>Set a budget early. Make it clear that billing should cover important legal matters only. You or the company can handle auxiliary tasks like reviewing your own employment contracts from the acquirer, supplying the waterfall structure from your cap table, or wiring final proceeds to shareholders. Lawyers won't volunteer this, but you can set a budget with them. You can also negotiate their rates. When they send the invoice, study each line item carefully. Pay only for the work they actually did.</p>
