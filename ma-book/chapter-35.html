  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>In mid August 2022, after close to a year of outreach, due diligence meetings, and endless iterations of our M&amp;A decks, the bubbly market we first saw in September 2021 was gone. Borui and I started with five real inbound inquiries from three tech giants and two unicorns. We were on friendly terms with companies that had previously approached us about acquisitions we turned down. We had partnerships with several Android OEMs. All of them said no.</p>
<p>What I expected to be a one-quarter sprint to find the best offer turned into no offer at all. Well, not entirely true. One private company that had raised over a hundred million dollars but was struggling to grow offered to take all our assets, IPs, and some team members in exchange for the lowest tier of common stock in their options pool. We would have been better off staying independent or returning our remaining cash to investors. The investors would have gotten a better payout. The team members would have had better job prospects.</p>
<p>I went through the seven stages of grief over six months. First came shock. I had thought those early meetings were extremely positive. Then denial and anger. Deals were still happening in mid 2022, but the market dried up fast. Then bargaining. I reached out to anyone who had shown interest or done any diligence with us, asking for any offer, even below what the investors had put in. I felt guilty for going down this path. There were weeks of intense depression. And finally, grudging acceptance. We had to keep operating independently. There was no longer a market for our company.</p>
<p>I still carry some guilt about 2022. Maybe I didn't speak up enough during initial meetings. Maybe I wasn't prepared enough. Or maybe I was too rigid about my vision for the joint venture and ignored what the acquirer was looking for. Either way, it was expensive tuition for my first startup. Inexperience cost us a deal that could have been much better than what we eventually got in 2025.</p>
<p>I sometimes wondered if our bankers were part of the problem. Maybe if we had talked to acquirers directly, the conversations would have been more straightforward, without the posturing or unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>I blamed the board for various things, but they were supportive throughout. They never set a minimum multiple that the deal had to hit for their approval.</p>
<p>Not getting an offer was a function of the market. Our thesis was creator economy and the metaverse. But halfway through the pandemic, the market shifted toward crypto. There was very little interest in what we were selling. Companies are always bought, not sold. No matter how strong our metrics were, we needed a buyer with a real offer. And there wasn't one.</p>
<p>If you're drowning in rejections and unanswered emails, know that this is normal. Even great companies with positive cash flow and deep technical talent don't get offers. It's not about you, your company, or your banker. It's the market.</p>
<p>But markets come back. Take what you learned from those conversations and figure out which products or technologies got positive feedback. Go back to the drawing board. Build the next version. As long as there is a path to profitability and you have the patience to make it through, a buyer will show up.</p>
