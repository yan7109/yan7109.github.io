  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>A fundraising deck lays out a vision and how you'll get there with an infusion of capital. An M&amp;A deck is different. It focuses on what you've already built and how your company could be the missing piece that helps the acquirer reach their goal. This is unnecessary if all your acquisition interest is inbound or from private equity. But it can still be a helpful exercise to align how you fit into the buyer's strategy.</p>
<p>If you're building the deck for an outbound target you're trying to convince to buy your company, come up with a few theses. How could this company use your platform, technology, product, or team to reach a business goal? This is a shot in the dark. What you think their strategy is may be completely wrong. So the idea is to establish a common set of beliefs. Maybe it's a vision for the future. An untapped market. A specific pain point that you're uniquely qualified to solve. Put these as the first slides in your outreach deck as the hook. Make sure they're customized for the company you're targeting.</p>
<p>After the hook, add a few slides that show what makes your company different. Make sure they're noteworthy. Generic information like headcount or vanity metrics like total downloads will get your deck thrown out. Put yourself in the shoes of a Corp Dev person who gets dozens of these decks from struggling startups. How do you become signal in all that noise?</p>
<p>Highlight things like explosive revenue growth, user net retention above the industry standard, or domain expertise on your team with PhDs in hard-to-hire fields. Unless your revenue is in the hundreds of millions and your daily active users are in the tens of millions, big tech acquirers won't care about your raw numbers. Your revenue and user base are a drop in the bucket at their scale. Focus instead on growth rate, domain expertise, or unique value that only your company can deliver.</p>
<p>Finish with a couple slides on the future and how joining forces gets both companies to the destination faster. Be specific. Make a few bold predictions about how the market is shifting. Explain why the acquiring company needs you to stay competitive or thrive in the middle of that change. Sell the buyer on a combination of fear and opportunity. Once you're done, practice it with your cofounders, board members, or advisors and get feedback.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough: do your homework on the target acquirer. Look for signals from their executive team. What space are they after? What problem are they trying to solve? What investments are they making? Read their interviews and news articles. Use the same language they use. The goal is to spark interest for a first meeting and find out if there's potential for an acquisition.</p>
<p>See appendix for a sample outreach deck that I used when selling Polarr.</p>
