  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>When you can't find a buyer, there are three groups of people to manage, ranked by importance: your cofounders, your board, and your employees.</p>
<p>The most important people to get on the same page with are your cofounders. Now is the time to get real. Figure out everyone's personal situation and goals. You may want to keep operating independently while your cofounder wants to cash out and move on. Be transparent and honest about what you want. Try to find common ground.</p>
<p>When we couldn't find a buyer in 2022, Borui and I both felt comfortable continuing. We had positive cash flow and the team was excited about a new product. In 2024, when we were waiting on offers again, we both knew that if it didn't work out this time, we were too emotionally scarred to continue. We would pursue other things.</p>
<p>The good part was that we communicated constantly about our situations and goals during these difficult times. We had heated discussions and debates, but things never got ugly. Nothing spilled over to the team or the board. We each said what we wanted, reasoned through it, and got on the same page.</p>
<p>I'm grateful this worked out. I know other founders who weren't as lucky. Even when the deal was going well, their cofounder relationship soured and blew everything up. The number one reason was that cofounders weren't transparent with each other, or couldn't resolve conflicts. This is the most important relationship you'll manage during an M&amp;A. Especially when things get tough.</p>
<p>Next is your board, which likely includes your key investors. If you have institutional investors, they've seen this play out a hundred times. If there's no deal, they've already marked this investment as a loss. They just want to recover whatever they can by taking back the company's remaining cash.</p>
<p>If you're burning cash with no M&amp;A offers, you'll face enormous pressure to return the remaining balance to investors. This is true even if your investors don't hold a majority. That means either buying out your investors and operating independently, or returning the cash and winding down.</p>
<p>You could try fundraising or a recapitalization, but that's an even tougher lift than M&amp;A. Your best leverage with investors is to make the business cash flow positive. Only if you earn more than you burn will you have the standing to keep building and retry the M&amp;A market later. If you want to keep operating independently, make the necessary cuts first.</p>
<p>Finally, your team. Ideally you've kept the circle small, so only a handful of key executives know about the process. When no offer comes, they'll ask what happened. Before involving anyone, set proper expectations: a deal is an outlier event. The most likely outcome is the status quo.</p>
<p>Some key employees may leave if a deal doesn't materialize. That's a real risk. But your job as the leader is to rally the team and lead the mission with or without the M&amp;A. Give them confidence that the future is bright and great things can still be accomplished independently.</p>
