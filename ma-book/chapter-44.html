  </div>

  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Even though the headline acquisition considerations and retention are already agreed upon, the acquiring company will now typically propose their own versions of retention bonus allocations, new compensation packages, titles, and the post-acquisition organizational structure. These are based on interviews and HR-related due diligence. As the founder and seller, you need to be proactive and strategic in these final negotiations.</p>
<p class="sub-header">1. Consideration and Retention Allocations</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>From experience, I've found it's advantageous to propose your own retention allocation plan to the buyer first. Offer a well-thought-out draft based on each team member's criticality to the integration and the future roadmap, not just seniority. This serves as a strong foundation for further discussions.

Make sure that retention payout and stock option schedules are structured evenly across the integration timeline. Avoid scenarios where team members feel incentivized to leave early or feel unfairly compensated if payouts are delayed too long. Also avoid the situation where the founders get the overwhelming majority of the retention bonus. Retention is a function of the team's criticality to a successful integration and its size.

Do ample research and talk to your bankers or advisors about what a reasonable allocation looks like for your situation. An allocation skewed towards founders could make the buyer think the founders are greedy. It could also lead to key contributors leaving from perceived unfairness. In the worst case, a buyer could call off the deal.</p>
<p>Send over a spreadsheet of your entire roster along with their titles, areas of responsibility, current salary, and proposed retention bonus breakdown to the acquirer. Add a notes column that provides the justifications for why each person is getting what they are getting. Then schedule a meeting to walk through the spreadsheet together. Throughout this negotiation, understand that the goal of the acquirer is to ensure that all the key stakeholders are appropriately incentivized and ensure that they stay for the entire retention period.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">2. Compensations</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Surprisingly, acquiring companies may initially suggest pay cuts for certain employees or executives rather than immediate raises post-acquisition. Most likely it is because your existing salaries are out of band compared to the acquiring company's internal payband. This is especially true if the acquiring company is outside of Silicon Valley.

Don't take these proposals personally. Calmly provide clear justifications for the current compensation rates of your team. Every detail in this negotiation is open for discussion. Rather than accepting base salary cuts, propose a modest increase in base salary balanced by a slight reduction in retention bonuses. This approach often feels more palatable and respectful to your employees.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">3. Titles</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Acquiring companies are usually conservative in assigning titles to new employees. They often down-level roles to maintain parity with their existing staff or as a reflection of interview performance.

But understand this. Being acquired and getting a return for all your stakeholders is the best title you will ever get in the startup business. Personally, I would not go to war if your title was previously CEO and post acquisition it is reduced to a general manager. There are rarely two CEOs in a company, and even rarer when the acquired company CEO steps in as the new CEO right away.

That said, if you genuinely believe in the potential of the acquiring company and foresee yourself or your team staying beyond the retention period, it can be beneficial to advocate for larger roles or more senior titles to better capture future upside.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">4. Team Reorganizations</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>Anticipate that the acquiring company will propose headcount reductions as part of team reorganizations. Push back if proposed reductions could hurt business outcomes or integration goals. There will be redundant roles. But perhaps there are other areas in the acquiring company that could use the extra headcount. Explore those avenues.

Communications about employee departures should not happen during the negotiation phase. Time them for the closing. Disclosing personnel changes before closing could crush morale. Key employees may even leave preemptively in anticipation that they may be let go.</p>
</div>
<p class="sub-header">5. Other HR Related Negotiation Topics</p>
<div class="sub-section">
<p>This phase is likely your final chance to negotiate additional benefits or considerations. Beyond standard items, discuss remote work policies, benefits alignment, or specific personal needs for key employees. Work visas, planned vacations, maternity leaves. Especially for those critical to integration. This is your opportunity to negotiate improved terms on employee benefits coverage or additional resources for the team's smooth transition.</p>
<p>While the headline terms may already be agreed upon, these detailed final negotiations significantly influence employee satisfaction and the success of integration. Engage proactively with the acquiring company. Communicate your rationale clearly. Stay collaborative but assertive to get the best outcome for everyone involved.</p>
