  <div class="chapter-body">
<p>Your outbound email may sound exciting. The darling startup that was never for sale is now on the market and contemplating offers. Everything is in motion and not acting now means missing the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. The base scenario is not an avalanche of nos. It's worse. It's getting no responses at all. These could be folks you have had a relationship with, people who have partnered with you and you thought would at least take a meeting. But the truth is, priorities change. Whatever your company is working on may no longer be the missing piece for the target company's big strategy. Their roles may have changed too. They may not be in a position to help this time around.</p>
<p>Don't let your ego bruise. This is the norm for M&A inquiries. Strong connections may jump on partnership opportunities, but M&As are a different beast. They require a huge amount of effort to pull off. It's completely normal to get one to two responses for every ten outbound inquiries. Don't be discouraged. You only need one yes.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble getting replies, iterate on finding the right contact or connection. Recalibrate on whether the target company still makes sense. Maybe you are not hitting the right targets. Maybe the connections are not strong enough. Maybe the material you are sending needs tuning. When we did our outbound reachout, we had a dozen iterations on the introduction slides based on market response.</p>
<p>When these continuous pings don't work, ask your board or investors if alternate contacts can be reached. Another option is to hire a banker. A great banker should have a rolodex of high ranking executives at companies you are trying to break into. This is where the money is well spent, hiring someone well-connected and articulate to look over your pitch and do the outbound on your behalf.</p>
<p>It could also be that the M&A market is simply not there, as we saw in 2022-2024 in tech. If that's the case, instead of pitching M&A, ask for a call to see if you can offer help. In exchange, learn what strategic initiatives the target executive is thinking about. People love to talk about themselves rather than listen to your pitch. If you can get a meeting, it's a great opportunity to build a relationship and find ways to potentially do a deal in the future.</p>
<p>M&A journeys are never linear. As long as you have a great company and a great team, the opportunity will eventually present itself. The goal of outbound reachout is to plant seeds. You never know. Down the road, one of those seeds could germinate and become an inbound inquiry.</p>
