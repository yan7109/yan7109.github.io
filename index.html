<h1>Derek Yan</h1>

<p class="muted">
Founder, engineer, and builder focused on applied AI products.
</p>

<p>
I’m Derek — a founder and technologist working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, product design, and creative software.
I previously co-founded Polarr and served as CTO, where we built AI-powered photo and video tools used by millions of creators and licensed computer vision systems across mobile, desktop, and embedded platforms (Samsung, LG, Western Digital, Xiaomi, OPPO, Lenovo and others).
</p>

<p>
My work spans machine learning, computer vision, edge inference, developer platforms, and human-centered product design. I care deeply about leveraging AI to help people save time and money.
</p>

<p>
In May 2025, Polarr was sold to Pixieset where I now serve as the Director of Engineering. In addition to integrating our products and team to Pixieset, I advise founders on startup exits and M&A and mess around with models.
