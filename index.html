<h1>Derek Z. H. Yan</h1>

<p class="muted">
Founder, CTO, software engineer.
</p>

<p>
I’m a founder and technologist working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, product design, and creative software. I co-founded Polarr, where I served as CTO and built AI-powered photo and video tools used by millions, and shipped computer vision systems across mobile, desktop, and embedded platforms (Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, OPPO, Lenovo, and others).
</p>

<p>
My work spans machine learning, computer vision, edge inference, developer platforms, and human-centered product design. I care deeply about building AI tools that save people time, reduce friction, and expand creative freedom.
</p>

<p>
In May 2025, Polarr was acquired by Pixieset, where I now serve as Director of Engineering. Alongside this, I take photos of my family and friends, advise founders on startup exits and M&A, and experiment with new foundation models.
