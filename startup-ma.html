<h1>Startup M&A</h1>

<p class="muted">The Toughest Sell - Even When You Have Willing Buyers: a Founder's Guide to Startup Exits</p>

<p>
It was the morning of May 15th, 2024. My mom's 60th birthday. Instead of planning a birthday message, I was obsessively checking my phone for an important email. After years of meetings, sleepless nights, and careful planning, I was expecting an acquisition term sheet from a $50 billion market cap company.
</p>

<p>
They had strong interest to buy our company back in 2021. My cofounder and I made the mistake of not following up with their founders after a positive first meeting. At that time we actually had a ton of inbound interests for acquisition, they all loved our product and technology. We hired reputable bankers who promised life-changing outcomes. Long and behold, the market soured. Despite having over a hundred conversations and a over dozens of high-leverage executive-level meetings, the only offer we got was a full stock deal from another startup that wanted our cash balance and recurring revenue.
</p>

<p>
That morning, after a swim at the YMCA, my Apple Watch buzzed mid-dead-hang. I let go of the bar to read the message. My heart sank. It wasn't a yes or no. It was a vague, long-winded email saying they needed more time. Our team, our board, my family had mentally committed to this deal. At that instant, the possibility of potentially winding down a company that had raised thirteen million dollars and was once a Silicon Valley darling felt brutally real.
</p>

<p>
I stood there, thinking. What now?
</p>

<h2>Why I Wrote a Book on M&A</h2>

<p>
We decided to test the M&A market in late 2021 after having had a number of serious acquisition inquiries. We thought it would be straightforward. We had decent revenue, was profitable, a lean and technical team, great product and technology, and strong partnerships. Instead, it took almost four years before we finally found the right buyer.
</p>

<p>
I desperately wished a book like this existed at the time.
</p>

<p>
Companies that go out actively looking for a buyer almost never find one. The skills required to sell a business are fundamentally different from the skills required to build it. Almost no resources exist to help founders make that transition. Worse, it will likely be the loneliest period of your life. Your team must be kept in the dark. Your investors may turn openly adversarial. Even your cofounders can end up on the other side of the table. And at home, your spouse may quietly wonder (or even openly beseech you) if you've lost your mind. In this environment, even the smallest inequity in the cap table or the tiniest crack in governance can suddenly surface—and blow up directly in your face.
</p>

<p>
This is the book I needed back then: a record of every mistake, antipattern, and dead end I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

<h2>To Fellow Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>
Most founders don't struggle during M&A because they lack effort or talent, they struggle because the M&A path is opaque, emotionally draining, rarely talked about honestly, and to be frank, different for everybody. Reality often falls far short of the expectations we place on ourselves, even if it's a great outcome.
</p>

<p>
If you're navigating an exit, thinking about one, or quietly wrestling with uncertainty about your company's future, you don't have to carry that alone.
</p>

<p>
I can't promise answers. But I'm happy to help, share what I learned the hard way, or simply be a sounding board. I can't promise to respond every email inquiry, but I'll do my best.
