<h1>The Toughest Sell</h1>

<p>
Companies that go out looking for a buyer almost <em>always</em> never find one. Even those with term sheets rarely close. We had everything going for us, strong inbound interest, enterprise contracts, products used by tens of millions, a technical team... And it still took four years, over a hundred conversations, and a couple of near-death experiences.

I wrote a book on this whole bloody experience, hopefully to help founders think clearly and not make the same mistakes I did. The stakes are way too high for the slightest errors.
