<h1>My Upcoming Book on M&A</h1>

<h2>Why I Wrote a Book on My M&A Experience</h2>

<p>
It was May 15th, 2024. My mom's 60th birthday. Instead of planning a birthday message, I was checking my phone for an acquisition term sheet from a $50 billion company.
</p>

<p>
They had shown strong interest back in 2021. My cofounder and I made the mistake of not following up after a positive first meeting. At the time we had tons of inbound interest—everyone loved our product. We hired bankers who promised life-changing outcomes. Then the market soured. Despite dozens of executive meetings, the only offer we got was a full stock deal from another startup that just wanted our cash.
</p>

<p>
That morning, my Apple Watch buzzed mid-workout. I let go of the pull-up bar to read it. My heart sank. Not a yes or no—just a vague email saying they needed more time. The possibility of winding down a company that had raised $13 million felt brutally real.
</p>

<p>
It took almost four years before we finally found the right buyer. I desperately wished a book like this existed at the time. This is the book I needed: a record of every mistake, antipattern, and dead end I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
</p>
